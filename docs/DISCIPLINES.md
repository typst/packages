# Typst Package Disciplines

Disciplines define the target audience of a package, making it easy for users to
discover domain-specific packages and templates. Not all packages are
domain-specific, those can simply omit the `disciplines` key from their
manifest. In addition to disciplines, packages can also specify a list of
[categories] describing their functionality.

Disciplines are standardized for discoverability. If you want to submit a
domain-specific package, but there isn't a fitting discipline in the list below,
please reach out to us!

- `agriculture`
