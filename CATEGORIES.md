# Typst Package Categories

Categories help users explore packages, make finding the right one easier, and
provide package authors with a reference for best-practices in their domain.

Each package can declare itself a part of up to three categories.

There are three kinds of package categories: Functional categories that describe
what the package does on a technical level, publication categories that describe
for which kind of deliverable a package may be used, and discipline categories
that mark a package as tailored towards an academic discipline.

Package authors are not required to pick a category from each of the three
groups. Instead, they can omit one group completely if it is not applicable to
their package, or use two categories for another group. Publication categories,
for example, are of big relevance to template packages and less so to a general
utility package that may apply to most publication kinds.

## Functional Categories
- **`components`:** Building blocks for documents. This includes boxes, layout
  elements, marginals, and more.
- **`design`:** Packages with a focus on design such as color palettes, icon
  packs, and templates with a distinct graphical direction.
- **`model`:** Tools for managing semantic information and references. Examples
  could be glossaries and bibliographic tools.
- **`languages`:** Tools for localization and internationalization as well as
  dealing with different scripts and languages in the same document.
- **`layout`:** Primitives and helpers to achieve advanced layouts and set up a
  page with headers, margins, and multiple content flows.
- **`text`:** Packages that transform text and strings or are focused on fonts.
- **`scripting`:** Libraries to enhance the scripting and automation experience
  in Typst.

  This also includes packages that embed a third-party binary as a plugin.

  data, information, and models.

  always entertaining.
