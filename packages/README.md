# Typst Packages
The package repository for Typst, where package authors submit their packages.
The packages submitted here are available on [Typst Universe][universe].

## Package format

A package is a collection of Typst files and assets that can be imported as a
unit. A `typst.toml` manifest with metadata is required at the root of a
package. [Read more about the manifest format][manifest].

## Published packages

This repository contains a collection of published packages. Due to its early
and experimental nature, all packages in this repository are scoped in a
`preview` namespace. A package that is stored in
`packages/preview/{name}/{version}` in this repository will become available in
Typst as `#import "@preview/{name}:{version}"`. You must always specify the full
package version.

You can use template packages to create new Typst projects with the CLI with
the `typst init` command or the web application by clicking the _Start from
template_ button.

If you want to submit your own package, you can follow [our documentation on
publishing packages][publishing] that will guide you through the process and
give you some tips.

### Downloads

The Typst compiler downloads packages from the `preview` namespace on-demand.
Once used, they are cached in `{cache-dir}/typst/packages/preview` where
`{cache-dir}` is

- `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` or `~/.cache` on Linux
- `~/Library/Caches` on macOS
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%` on Windows

Importing a cached package does not result in network access.

## Local packages

Want to install a package locally on your system without publishing it or
experiment with it before publishing? You can store packages in
`{data-dir}/typst/packages/{namespace}/{name}/{version}` to make them available
locally on your system. Here, `{data-dir}` is

- `$XDG_DATA_HOME` or `~/.local/share` on Linux
- `~/Library/Application Support` on macOS
- `%APPDATA%` on Windows

Packages in the data directory have precedence over ones in the cache directory.
While you can create arbitrary namespaces with folders, a good namespace for
system-local packages is `local`:

- Store a package in `~/.local/share/typst/packages/local/mypkg/1.0.0`
- Import from it with `#import "@local/mypkg:1.0.0": *`

Note that future iterations of Typst's package management may change/break this
local setup.
