# almost-tud-letter

A Typst template that (more or less) replicates the [TUDelft letter](https://www.tudelft.nl/huisstijl/) (only available in Word).
It also makes it more beautiful in my opinion, but hey I guess it's subjective...

By default it's in English and the faculty name is my faculty... but you can modify it, see the example. 
You can also put `lang: "nl"` so that the fields top-left are in Dutch.

## How to use it?

You can compile the example letter with this command:

`typst compile --root . template/letter.typ`

Notice that you can also install the package manually to your local Typst, see instruction there:

```typst
#import "@preview/almost-tud-letter:0.1.0": *
