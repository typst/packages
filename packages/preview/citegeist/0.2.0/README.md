# Citegeist: Direct bibtex access for Typst

This package reads a Bibtex file and returns its contents as as a [Typst dictionary](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/dictionary/). It does not attempt to typeset a bibliography and is not interested in CSL styles; all it does is return the raw Bibtex entries. It leaves all further processing to your Typst code.

Citegeist is a thin wrapper around the [Typst biblatex crate](https://github.com/typst/biblatex), which reads a bibtex file into a Rust data structure. Citegeist simply makes this data structure available to Typst code.


## Usage

Use the `load-bibliography` command to parse a bibtex string into a Typst dictionary:

```
#import "@preview/citegeist:0.2.0": load-bibliography

#let bibtex_string = read("custom.bib")
#let bib = load-bibliography(bibtex_string)

#bib.bender-koller-2020-climbing
```

This will print the bibtex entry for the key `bender-koller-2020-climbing`:

```
(
	entry_type: "inproceedings",
	entry_key: "bender-koller-2020-climbing",
	fields: (

		this position paper, we argue that a system trained only on form has a priori no way
		to learn meaning. In keeping with the ACL 2020 theme of ``Taking Stock of Where We've
		Been and Where We're Going'', we argue that a clear understanding of the distinction
		between form and meaning will help guide the field towards better science around
		natural language understanding.",

	)
)
```

Note that you have to `read` the contents of the Bibtex file yourself, because Typst packages can only read files within the package.


## Details

The function `load-bibliography` returns a dictionary with one element per bibliography entry in your Bibtex file. The key of the dictionary element is the Bibtex key (in the example, `bender-koller-2020-climbing`); the value is a data structure representing a Bibtex entry.

A Bibtex entry is represented as another dictionary, see the example above. It has three keys: `entry_type` is the Bibtex entry type (e.g. `inproceedings` or `article`); `entry_key` is the key of the Bibtex entry; and `fields` contains all the fields of the Bibtex entry.

The `parsed_names` entry contains the values of all name-list fields, as parsed by the biblatex crate.
The crate is pretty good at respecting the different ways in which names can be specified in the
original Biblatex.
