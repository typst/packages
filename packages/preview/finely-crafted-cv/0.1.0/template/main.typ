= Research Philosophy

My approach to marine biology is rooted in curiosity, collaboration, and
conservation. I believe in conducting rigorous scientific research that not only
advances our understanding of marine ecosystems but also informs policy
decisions to protect our oceans. By fostering interdisciplinary partnerships and
engaging with local communities, I strive to create impactful solutions that
balance human needs with ecological preservation.
