/// An anchor used to search from. When using `hydra` ouside of the page header, this should be
/// placed inside the pge header to find the correct searching context. `hydra` always searches from
/// the last anchor it finds, if and only if it detects that it is outside of the top-margin.
#let anchor() = [#metadata(()) <hydra-anchor>]

/// Query for an element within the bounds of its ancestors.
///
/// The context passed to various callbacks contains the resolved top-margin, the current location,
/// as well as the binding direction, primary and ancestor element selectors and customized
/// functions.
///
/// This function is contextual.
///
/// - ..sel (any): The element to look for, to use other elements than headings, read the
///   documentation on selectors. This can be an element function or selector, or an integer
///   declaring a heading level.
/// - prev-filter (function, auto): A function which receives the `context` and `candidates`, and
///   returns if they are eligible for display. This function is called at most once. The primary
///   next candidate may be none. If this is `auto` no filter is applied.
/// - next-filter (function, auto): A function which receives the `context` and `candidates`, and
///   returns if they are eligible for display. This function is called at most once. The primary
///   prev candidate may be none. If this is `auto` no filter is applied.
/// - display (function, auto): A function which receives the `context` and candidate element to
///   display. If this is `auto`, the default implementaion will be used.
/// - skip-starting (bool): Whether `hydra` should show the current candidate even if it's on top of
///   the current page.
/// - dir (direction, auto): The reading direction of the document. If this is `auto`, the text
///   direction is used. Be cautious about leaving this option on `auto` if you switch text
///   direction mid-page and use hydra outside of footers or headers.
/// - binding (alignement, auto): The binding of the document. If this is `auto`, the binding is
///   inferred from `dir`, similar to how it is done in page. Be cautious about leaving this on
///   option on `auto` if you switch text direction mid-page and use hydra outside of footers or
///   headers.
/// - book (bool): The binding direction if it should be considered, `none` if not. If the binding
///   direction is set it'll be used to check for redundancy when an element is visible on the last
///   page. Make sure to set `binding` and `dir` if the document is not using left-to-right reading
///   direction.
/// - anchor (label, none): The label to use for the anchor if `hydra` is used outside the header.
///   If this is `none`, the anchor is not searched.
