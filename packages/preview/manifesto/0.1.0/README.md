# Manifesto for Typst

**Manifesto** 📚 is the first HTML Typst documentation template for packages, built to be very easy to use. It is **100% written in Typst, responsive** and directly uses your `typst.toml` to automatically get your package information.

## Options

The `template` function accepts a few parameters to customize the data displayed on the website.

| Option | Default value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `title` (required) |  | The title of your package |
| `toml` | `none` | The path to the `typst.toml` file |
| `version` | `none` | Your package version |
| `description` | `none` | Your package description |
| `repository` | `none` | Your package repository URL (e.g. GitHub) |
| `universe` | `none` | Your package name on Typst universe name |
| `license` | `none` | Your package license |

Note that giving the `toml` file is aready enough, and will fill in the other options.
