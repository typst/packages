= Conclusion

*Instructions from the @pfc Coordination:*

The conclusion presents a *personal, objective, concise, and interpreted synthesis* of the results of the work.

Broadly speaking, it should summarize what was done and the overall results (in relation to the objectives initially defined). Examples of points to be addressed include:

- Did the method work? Were the expected results achieved? Was it shown to be better than the previous method?
- Organizational, technological, financial, ethical, ecological, etc. impacts;
- Suggestions for future work.
