= Introduction

*Generic standard instructions from the @tcc:pl of the University Library:*

The guidelines presented here are based on a set of standards developed by the @abnt. In addition to these technical standards, the Library has also prepared a series of tutorials, guides, and templates, all available on its website: http://portal.bu.ufsc.br/normalizacao/.

Alongside the use of this template, it is recommended to also use the *Tutorial for Academic Papers* (available at https://repositorio.ufsc.br/handle/123456789/180829).

This template is configured only for single-sided printing. Printing on both sides is not yet implemented, but is something on the author's roadmap for this template.

According to Regulatory Resolution No. 46/2019/CPG, dissertations and theses are no longer to be delivered in printed format to the University Library. Check with the UFSC Institutional Repository or your Graduate Program Office for submission procedures.

*Instructions from the @pfc Coordination:*

In this first chapter, it is very important to make it clear (in a summarized way, without going into technical details, just to give the reader a general idea):

- the problem addressed in the @pfc;
- the importance of the problem to the company or institution where the @pfc was carried out;
- the proposed solution;
- the methodology used;
- the results obtained and their relevance to the company/clients;
- what was actually done by the author, distinguishing it from what was reused from previous works or other teams within the company. *Important:* this concern with distinguishing the author’s work from that of possible colleagues in a team project should be present throughout the document.

Although the length of the monograph is not directly correlated with the grade, good works are rarely well reported in fewer than 50 pages. Above 100 pages, the monograph may become tedious, going beyond what is necessary for understanding the work and thus losing the reader’s focus.

The language used in an academic work must be technical and scientific, therefore formal (not informal, as if explaining the work to a friend or relative). Thus, slang should not be used. Use a spell checker and review grammar (punctuation, use of commas, agreement, textual cohesion, etc.).

== Objectives

Here the objectives are described, which can be divided into a general objective and specific objectives.

Another option is to present the specific objectives as steps in a work methodology, that is, the procedures and tools adopted in each phase of the project (a work plan).

#noindent[DOCUMENT STRUCTURE]

\

At the end of the introductory chapter, it is customary to describe how the document is structured (the sequence of the following chapters). The suggested structure below is general and does not need to be followed strictly: depending on the area and focus of the work, the number of chapters may vary. The student should consult their advisor at UFSC to define the document’s structure.

Chapter 2 provides a description of the company (institution where the @pfc was carried out) and its processes/products.

Chapter 3 presents the theoretical foundation: theories, models, etc. essential for understanding the proposed solution are discussed.

Chapter 4 sets out the general, functional, and non-functional requirements to be considered in the project. Information and material flows, diagrams, etc. can also be used to outline the expected results of the proposed solution. A model of the plant, for instance, may be developed and identified here.

Chapter 5 describes in detail the project (hardware, software) that was carried out. The solution is formalized through diagrams, use cases, graphical interfaces, and controller design, including the decisions made and their rationale, in alignment with the defined requirements. In control-related projects, this is where the controller design is presented.

Chapter 6 provides an analysis of results: advantages and disadvantages, and the impact of the results on the company’s processes. Indicators, charts, statistics, etc. should be used for this analysis.

The final chapter presents the conclusion of the @pfc. It includes a summary of what was done, revisiting the motivation of the work, the proposed solution, and the main results achieved. It should also analyze the project’s limitations and point out possible improvements in case the work is to be continued (suggestions for future work).
