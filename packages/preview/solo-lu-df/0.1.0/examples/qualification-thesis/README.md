Qualification thesis example (solo-lu-df)

This folder contains a ready-to-edit qualification-thesis example built with
the `solo-lu-df` Typst template:

- `main.typ` — Typst source (the example document).
- `bibliography.yml` — example bibliography entries.
- `utils/` — helper snippets for diagrams/tables used by the example.

## How to edit

Open `examples/qualification-thesis/main.typ` and modify the `ludf.with(...)`
call to change title, authors, advisors, date, place, abstract, bibliography,
and attachments. The example demonstrates:

- Title/author/advisor metadata
- Primary and secondary abstracts with keywords
- Attachments (tables)
- Simple DPD/ER diagrams via `fletcher` or external images and local helpers
