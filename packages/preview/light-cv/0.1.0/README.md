In the folder `settings` you will a file `styles.typ` which includes all used styles. You can customize them as you want to.

## Multi Language Support

If you want to add a new language, copy the `cv-en.typ` and rename it. Afterwards you can adapt the text correspondingly. Maybe I will introduce i18n in the future.
