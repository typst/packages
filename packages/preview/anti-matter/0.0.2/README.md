#set page("a4", height: auto)
#show heading.where(level: 1): it => pagebreak(weak: true) + it

// add a title page and reset the counter
#[
  #set page(numbering: none)
  #counter(page).update(0)
]

#show: anti-matter

#include "front-matter.typ"
#anti-front-end()

#include "chapters.typ"
#anti-inner-end()

#include "back-matter.typ"

## Features
- Marking the start and end of front/end matter.
- Specifying the numbering styles for each matter and regular content

## FAQ
1. Why are the pages not correctly counted?
   - If you are setting your own page header, you must use `anti-header`, see section II in the
     [manual].
2. Why is my outline not displaying the correct numbering?
   - If you configure your own `outline.entry`, you must use `anti-page-at`, see section II in the
     [manual].
3. Why does my front/inner/back  matter numbering start on the wrong page?
   - The markers must be on the last page of their respective matter, if you have a `pagebreak`
     forcing them on the next page it will also incorrectly label that page.
   - Otherwise please open an issue with a minimal reproducible example.

## Etymology
The package name `anti-matter` was choosen as a word play on front/back matter.
