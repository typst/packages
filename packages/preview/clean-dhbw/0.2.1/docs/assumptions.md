# Assumptions

For the development of the "*Clean DHBW Typst Template*", I've made the following assumptions: 

- The main "end-users" of these documents are the reviewers at DHBW and its partner companies.
- The documents are used for linear reading (*lineares Lesen*) as well as for selective reading (*selektierendes Lesen*). I.e. within the review process the document is typically read from beginning to end and on further review steps the reader will lookup specific sections or pages again.
- The majority of users will read these documents on-screen using some sort of PDF-reader. If printed on paper, a one-sided layout will be used and the document is bound or stapled on the left-hand side.
