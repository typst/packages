# Touying Clean Theme

A minimalistic, clean and simple [Touying](https://touying-typ.github.io/) slide theme for [Typst](https://typst.app). Theme design is deeply inspired by Grant McDermott's [Clean theme](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean) for [Quarto](https://quarto.org) + [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com).

## Quarto Clean Theme

This theme is also available as a Quarto + Typst theme. For more information, see the [Quarto-Clean-Typst](https://github.com/kazuyanagimoto/quarto-clean-typst).

## Limitations

Since Quarto's Typst does not correspond to the latest version of Typst, the supported version of Touying and Typst are not the latest.

I mainly use this theme from Quarto, so the feedbacks from the native Typst users are welcome.
