It is recommended to us Visual Studio code to edit the document. It can manage the connection to

Typst must of course be installed (https://typst.app/open-source#download).There is also a web app available to at the same website. The template makes use of two fonts which must be installed on the local machine:

- Font Awesome (free version): https://fontawesome.com/download
