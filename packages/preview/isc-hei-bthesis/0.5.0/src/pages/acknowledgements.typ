The *Acknowledgements* section of a bachelor thesis is where you express gratitude to those who supported you during your research and writing process. It is an *OPTIONAL* section. It may include:

- Academic supervisors or advisors who provided guidance. 
- Professors or instructors who offered feedback or resources.
- Family and friends for emotional or practical support.
- Institutions or organizations that provided funding, facilities, or data.
- Anyone else who contributed significantly to your work. 
 
Keep this section concise and sincere. It is typically placed after the abstract and before the main content of your thesis.
