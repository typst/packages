#heavy-title("Abstract")

The abstract of a bachelor thesis should provide a concise summary of the entire work. It typically includes:

- The context and motivation for the research.
- The main objective or research question.
- A brief description of the methodology or approach used.
- The key results or findings.
- The main conclusion or implications of the work.

The abstract should be self-contained, clear, and usually does not exceed 250–300 words. It allows readers to quickly understand the purpose and outcomes of the thesis without reading the full document.

The abstract *must* be written in both French and English.
