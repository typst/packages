# divine-words

A simple template for creating lab reports in [Typst](https://typst.app/home/). While it is in Spanish and created based on my reports, I hope someone could find it useful.

The template includes several variables that can be defined:
- **title**: The title of the report.
- **institution**: The name of the institution.
- **authors**: The authors of the report.
- **abstract**: A brief summary of the report in English.
- **resumen**: A brief summary of the report in Spanish.
- **keywords**: Keywords related to the report in English.
- **palabras clave**: Keywords related to the report in Spanish.

## Dependencies

This template uses the following package:

[indenta](https://typst.app/universe/package/indenta): Provides indentation at the beginning of each paragraph.
