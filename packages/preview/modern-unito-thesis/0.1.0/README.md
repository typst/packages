# UniTO Thesis Typst Template

This is a thesis template for the University of Turin (UniTO) based on [my thesis](https://github.com/eduardz1/Bachelor-Thesis), since there are no strict templates (notable mention to [Eugenio's LaTeX template though](https://github.com/esenes/Unito-thesis-template)) take my choices with a grain of salt, different supervisors may ask you to customize the template differently. My choices are loosely based on this document: [Indicazioni per il Format della Tesi](https://elearning.unito.it/sme/pluginfile.php/29485/mod_folder/content/0/format_TESI_2011-2012.pdf).

If you find errors or ways to improve the template please open an issue or contribute directly with a PR.

## Usage

In the Typst web app simply click "Start from template" on the dashboard and search for `modern-unito-thesis`.

From the CLI you can initialize the project with the command

```bash
typst init @preview/modern-unito-thesis
```

A new directory with all the files needed to get started will be created.

## Configuration

This template exports the `template` function with the following named arguments:

- `title`: the title of the thesis
- `academic-year`: the academic year (e.g. 2023/2024)
- `subtitle`: e.g. "Bachelor's Thesis"
- `paper-size` (default `a4`): the paper format
- `candidate`: your name, surname and matricola (student id)
- `supervisor` (relatore): your supervisor's name and surname
- `co-supervisor` (correlatore): an array of your co-supervisors' names and surnames
- `affiliation`: a dictionary that specifies `university`, `school` and `degree` keywords
- `lang`: configurable between `en` for English and `it` for Italian
- `bibliography-path`: the path to your bibliography file (e.g. `works.bib`)
- `logo` (already set to UniTO's logo by default): the path to your university's logo
- `abstract` : your thesis' abstract, can be set to `none` if not needed
- `acknowledgments` : your thesis' acknowledgments, can be set to `none` if not needed
- `keywords`: a list of keywords for the thesis, can be set to `none` if not needed

The template will initialize an example project with sensible defaults.

The template divides the level 1 headings in chapters under the `chapters` directory, I suggest using this structure to keep the project organized.

If you want to change an existing project to use this template, you can add a show rule like this at the top of your file:

```typ
#import "@preview/modern-unito-thesis:0.1.0": template

#show: template.with(
  title: "My Beautiful Thesis",
  academic-year: [2023/2024],
  subtitle: "Bachelor's Thesis",
  logo: image("path/to/your/logo.png"),
  candidate: (
    name: "Eduard Antonovic Occhipinti",
    matricola: 947847
  ),
  supervisor: (
    "Prof. Luigi Paperino"
  ),
  co-supervisor: (
    "Dott. Pluto Mario",
    "Dott. Minni Topolino"
  ),
  affiliation: (
    university: "Universit√† degli Studi di Torino",
    school: "Scuola di Scienze della Natura",
    degree: "Corso di Laurea Triennale in Informatica",
  ),
  bibliography: bibliography("works.yml"),
  abstract: [Your abstract goes here],
  acknowledgments: [Your acknowledgments go here],
  keywords: [keyword1, keyword2, keyword3]
)

// Your content goes here
```

## Compile

To compile the project from the CLI you just need to run

```bash
typst compile main.typ
```

or if you want to watch for changes (recommended)

```bash
typst watch main.typ
```

## Bibliography

I integrated the bibliography as a [Hayagriva](https://github.com/typst/hayagriva) `yaml` file under [works.yml](template/works.yml), nonetheless using the more common `bib` format for your bibliography management is as simple as passing a BibTex file to the template `bibliography` parameter. Given that our university is not strict in this regard I suggest using Hayagriva though :).
