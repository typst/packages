[Typst](https://typst.app/home/) paper template for mathematical papers built for simple, efficient use and a clean look.
Of course, it can also be used for other subjects, but the following math-specific features are already contained in the template:

- theorems, lemmas, corollaries, proofs etc. prepared using [great-theorems](https://typst.app/universe/package/great-theorems)
- equation settings

## Set-Up

The template is already filled with dummy data, to give users an impression how it looks like. The paper is obtained by compiling `main.typ`.

- after [installing Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) you can conveniently use the following to create a new folder containing this project.

```bash
typst init @preview/clean-math-paper:0.1.0
```

- edit the data in `main.typ` â†’ `#show template.with([your data])`

### Parameters of the Template

- `title`: Title of the paper.
- `authors`: List of names of the authors of the paper. Each entry of the list is a dictionary with the following keys:
  - `name`: Name of the author.
  - `affiliation-id`: The ID of the affiliation in `affiliations`, see below.
  - optionally `orcid`: The [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) of the author. If provided, the author's name will be linked to their ORCID profile.
- `affiliations`: List of affiliations of the authors. Each entry of the list is a dictionary with the following keys:
  - `id`: ID of the affiliation, which is used to link the authors to the affiliation, see above.
  - `name`: Name of the affiliation.
- `date`: Date of the paper.
- `heading-color`: Color of the headings including the title.
- `link-color`: Color of the links.
