# ISC report template :scroll:

This is an official template for students reports for the [ISC degree programme](https://isc.hevs.ch/) at the School of engineering in Sion. 

## Using the template

In the Typst web application, start with the `modern-isc-report` and voil√† ! Using the CLI, you can initialize the project with the command : 

```bash
typst init @preview/modern-isc-report
```

This template will initialize an sample report with sensible default values.

## Installing fonts locally

If you are running `typst` locally, you might need to download fonts. For your convenience, all the required fonts are included in the original repos [residing here](https://github.com/ISC-HEI/ISC-report), which is not a problem because they were all released using the [SIL Open Font License](https://openfontlicense.org/) which is included in this repository.

To the install the fonts in a Linux environment, simply type

```bash
source install_fonts.sh
```

from within the `fonts` directory and the fonts will be installed.

## PDF images inclusion

Unfortunately, `typst` does not support PDF file types inclusion. As a temporary workaround, PDF files can be converted to SVG via `pdf2svg`.

# Usage

Locally, after modifying `report.typ`, creating a PDF is straightforward with the command

```bash
typst compile report.typ
```

or using 

```bash
typst watch report.typ
```

Another nice possibility is of course to use a VScod[e | ium] via the `Typst LSP` plugin which enables direct compilation.

# Future changes

In the future, several things _might_ be updated, such as :

- [x] Acronyms inclusion
- [ ] Glossary inclusion
- [ ] Master thesis version of this template
- [ ] Themes for code
- [ ] Other nice things

# Questions and help

If you need any help for installing or running those tools, do not hesitate to get in touch with its maintainer [pmudry](https://github.com/pmudry).

You can of course also propose changes using PR or raise issues if something is not clear. Have fun writing reports!
