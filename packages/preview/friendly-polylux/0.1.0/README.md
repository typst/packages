# Friendly

A friendly and playful template for creating presentation slides with Typst and
[Polylux](https://github.com/polylux-typ/polylux/).

![thumbnail](thumbnail.png)


Use via
```sh
typst init @preview/friendly-polylux your-cool-project
```

A `slides.typ` file will be created for you that you can directly edit to get
going.
The template features a prominent title slide as well as a dedicated last slide
that you can configure.
These display QR codes for better accessibility for your audience.
Generating these QR codes happens behind the scenes using [the tiaoma package](
https://typst.app/universe/package/tiaoma).

Read the [Polylux book](https://polylux.dev/book) to see what you can do with
Polylux.
