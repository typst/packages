# ennui-ur-report
Since University of Rennes doesn't have an official template.
This is a minimal, highly customizable, non-official attempt of one.

Feel free to open a PR if this template doesn't cover your use case, or you would like to add a
feature :)

## Namesake
ennui because it's boring. Also because inside out is a nice movie.

## Example
You can either use this as a simple handout, or a more sophisticated internship report.
Check out examples folder in the repository for these examples, or docs folder for the handbook.

## TODOS
- [x] pick a non canonical package name
- [x] update examples to package name and not relative path
- [ ] reimplement appendix when it is possible to figure out how to handle the counter
- [ ] show logo when coverpage is turned off? if so, what should the layout be?
