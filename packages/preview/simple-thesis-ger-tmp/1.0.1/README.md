## Purpose:
A simple, clean thesis templete with a wide range of functionality.

## Usage

The template can be initialized via `typst init`.
E.g.:

```bash
typst init @preview/simple-thesis-ger-host:1.0.1
```


## How to Start:

Importing all files.

The main file is: 0_main.typ
In the main file you can see every implementet file, and the main (global) layout settings.
Use the implementet file as example to implement your own chapters. 
It is only dependent from glosasarium so you possibly have to install it first (if you use typst offline on your maschiene)
