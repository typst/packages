= 0048. Rotate Image

You are given an $n times n$ 2D `matrix` representing an image, rotate the image by *90 degrees* (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image *in-place*, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. *Do not* allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

_Note: In Typst, we return the rotated matrix instead of modifying in-place._
