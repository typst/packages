= 0062. Unique Paths

There is a robot on an $m times n$ grid. The robot is initially located at the *top-left corner* (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the *bottom-right corner* (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers $m$ and $n$, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.
