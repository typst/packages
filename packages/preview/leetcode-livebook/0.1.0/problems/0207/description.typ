= 0207. Course Schedule

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from $0$ to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [a, b]` indicates that you *must* take course `b` first if you want to take course `a`.

For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course $0$ you have to first take course $1$.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.
