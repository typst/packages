= Constrained Equations

@BC:pla constrain the @DOF:pla of the @PDE:pla they act on.

#abbr.config(style: it => text(red, it), space-char: sym.arrow.l.r)

@BC:pla constrain the @DOF:pla of the @PDE:pla they act on.

#abbr.add("MOL", "Method of Lines")
The @MOL is a procedure to solve @PDE:pla in time.

= A note about trains

The @TGV has a commercial speed of up to 320 km/h.
