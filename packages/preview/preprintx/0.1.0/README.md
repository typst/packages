## API

### preprintx.with

- **title**: `String` - Title of the document.
- **authors**: `Array<(String, String)>` - List of author tuples containing (name, affiliation indices). 
  - Format: `("Last, First", "1,2,✉")` where numbers are affiliation indices and ✉ indicates correspondence
- **affils**: `Dictionary` - Dictionary mapping affiliation indices to institution names.
  - Format: `("1": "Institution Name", "2": "Another Institution")`
- **abstract**: `Content` - Abstract of the document.
- **keywords**: `Array<Content>` - List of keywords wrapped in brackets or quotes.
- **correspondence**: `String` - Email address for correspondence.

### Author Format

Authors should be formatted as tuples:
```typst
("Last, First", "affiliation_indices")
```

Where:
- `"Last, First"` is the author's name in "Last, First" format
- `"affiliation_indices"` contains comma-separated numbers corresponding to affiliations, with optional ✉ for correspondence

### Affiliation Format

Affiliations should be provided as a dictionary:
```typst
affils: (
  "1": "First Institution",
  "2": "Second Institution", 
  "3": "Third Institution"
)
```

## Features

- Two-column layout 
- Title, author block, and figures span the full width of the page
- Serif font (STIX Two Text) for body text, sans-serif (Helvetica) for headings and captions
- Automatic author formatting with superscript affiliation numbers
- Footer with author name(s) and page numbers
- Figure and table placement with proper captions
- Bibliography support with Nature style by default
- Responsive heading styles (3 levels supported)

## Fonts
This template requires these two fonts to be installed on your system:

- [STIX Two Text](https://github.com/stipub/stixfonts/tree/master/zipfiles)
- Helvetica

## To do

- Without `#v(-3em)` prior to references, there is too much of a break
- Better support for figure placement
