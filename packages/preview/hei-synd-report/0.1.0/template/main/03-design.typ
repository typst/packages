  This chapter defines the overall system architecture, core components, and interactions between different parts. The goal is to translate the specifications into a concrete, actionable blueprint for development.

  Key elements:
  - *Define the architecture* – What are the main components of the system, and how do they interact?
  - *Select technologies* – What programming languages, tools, or frameworks will be used? Why?
  - *Design data structures* – How will data be organized and processed?
  - *Create process flow* – What are the key steps or workflows in the system?
  - *Plan modularity & scalability* – How can the design adapt to future needs or extensions?
  - *Address constraints* – What design choices were made due to performance, security, or usability considerations?
