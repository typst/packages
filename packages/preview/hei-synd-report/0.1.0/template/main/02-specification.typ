  This chapter defines the project requirements and presents the theoretical background. If applicable, it should also include a *State of the art* review to compare existing solutions and justify the chosen approach.

  Key elements:
  - *Define the requirements* – What must the system/process be able to do?
  - *Describe the architecture* – What are the key components of the solution?
  - *Review existing solutions* – What approaches already exist? How does yours compare?
  - *Explain design choices* – Why did you choose this approach? What alternatives were considered?
