  This chapter assesses the correctness and performance of the implementation. It includes testing methods, simulations, and any validation techniques used to ensure the system meets its requirements.

  Key elements:
  - *Explain verification methods* – How do you ensure the system functions correctly?
  - *Describe validation techniques* – How do you prove that the solution meets its objectives?
  - *Present test results* – What experiments, simulations, or benchmarks were conducted?
  - *Discuss findings* – What do the results show? Were there unexpected outcomes?
