# Alexandria

This package provides an alternative to the built-in bibliography to allow a single document to have multiple bibliographies.

This package currently has a few limitations, such as not being able to collapse citations yet, but more general support is planned soon.

## Getting Started

To add this package to your project, use this:

```typ
#import "@preview/alexandria:0.1.2": *

#show: alexandria(prefix: "x-", read: path => read(path))

...

#bibliographyx(
  "bibliography.bib",
  // title: auto is not yet supported so it needs to be specified
  title: "Bibliography",
)
```

Parts of the Rust plugin that interfaces with the [Hayagriva](https://github.com/typst/hayagriva) citation library are based on [typst-library's `bibliography.rs`](https://github.com/typst/typst/blob/26e65bfef5b1da7f6c72e1409237cf03fb5d6069/crates/typst-library/src/model/bibliography.rs). Likewise, the example bibliographies are taken or adapted from [typst-dev-assets' `works.bib`](https://github.com/typst/typst-dev-assets/blob/1dba4bea22e5e19597fbf5f321b047ff7626e2d0/files/bib/works.bib).
