# Basic Resume

<div align="center">Version 0.1.4</div>

This is a template for a simple resume. It is intended to be used as a good starting point for quickly crafting a standard resume that will properly be parsed by ATS systems. Inspiration is taken from [Jake's Resume](https://github.com/jakegut/resume) and [guided-resume-starter-cgc](https://typst.app/universe/package/guided-resume-starter-cgc/). I'm currently a college student and was unable to find a Typst resume template that fit my needs, so I wrote my own. I hope this template can be useful to others as well.

## Sample Resume

## Quick Start

A barebones resume looks like this, which you can use to get started.

#let github = "github.com/stuxf"
#let linkedin = "linkedin.com/in/stuxf"
#let phone = "+1 (xxx) xxx-xxxx"
#let personal-site = "stuxf.dev"

#show: resume.with(
  author: name,
  // All the lines below are optional. 
  // For example, if you want to to hide your phone number:
  // feel free to comment those lines out and they will not show.
