== Example Use of the Theorem Environment <sec:example_theorem>
 An example citation is @Cooley65, then we also see the bibliography at the end of the document.

Example definition in @def:Example. This and all the following are examples using `great-theorems`.
#definition(title: "Example Definition")[
  This is how a definition looks like in this template.
  To also have a definition we state
  $
  e = sum_(k=0)^oo 1/k!.
  $
]<def:Example>

#example(title: "Example Example")[
  The exponential function at $a in RR$ can be expressed as
  $
  e ^a = sum_(k=0)^oo a^k/k!.
  $
]<ex:Fourier_Gaussian>

#theorem[
  The number $e$ is irrational
]
#proof[
  The proof that $e$ is irrational is left to the reader.
]


#remark(title: "Further Theorem Environments")[
  For a complete list of theorem environments, have a look at `customization/great-theorems-customization.typ`. There we can also change colors, other preferences, or add more environments if needed.
]
#lemma(title: "what about " + $sqrt(2)$ + "?")[
  We state $sqrt(2) in RR without QQ$.
]
#proof[
  Trivial, but the proof is not done yet.

  To demonstrate the breaking behaviour we add another

== Example Equations <sec:example_equations>
Here we will have some equations. E.g.
$
(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2a b + b^2
$<eq:first_binom>
which is labeled and therefore numbered. We can also reference it: @eq:first_binom.
In the following, we have a multiline equation to demonstrate how `equate` handles it.
$
15^2 &= (10 + 5)^2 \
&= 10^2 + 2 * 10 * 5 + 5^2 \
&= 100 + 100 + 25 \
&= 225.
$<eq:multi_line_binom>
Equations that are not of the same importance can be inline, e.g. $(a + b) (a - b) = a^2 - b^2$ or unlabeled
$
(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2a b + b^2.
$
To make sure we do not break inline equations, we have this long equation$a^2 + b^2 = c^2; a,b,c in RR subset.not QQ := {m/n : m,n in ZZ} subset.not ZZ subset.not NN_0 := NN union {0}.$ As we see, it works.

=== Example Algorithm, Table and Figure <sec:example_algo_table_and_fig>

Here we have a complicated procedure in @algo:example_algo (using `lovelace`) which we could elaborate on for pages
#figure(
  kind: "algorithm",
  supplement: [Algorithm],
  pseudocode-list(booktabs: true, numbered-title: [#smallcaps[Example Algorithm]])[
    - Input: $A, B, C$ 
    + *for* $i in {A,B,C}$ #v(1mm)
      + do very fancy stuff
      + #line-label(<line:stopping>)*if* motivation is lost: *break*

    + *end*
  ],
)<algo:example_algo>

Because we do not want an empty list of figures, we can add the logos from the cover page once again in @fig:example
#figure(
  grid(
    columns: 2,     // 2 means 2 auto-sized columns
    gutter: 2mm,    // space between columns
    image("../images/logo_placeholder.svg", width: 90%), // first image
    image("../images/logo_placeholder.svg", width: 90%), // second image
  ),
  caption: "Two beautiful images."
)<fig:example>

#lorem(20)

In @table:irrational_numbers we compare some irrational numbers, my favourite one is marked in green.

#figure(
  caption: "Some irrational numbers.",
  table(
  columns: 2,
  stroke: none,
    [], table.vline(stroke: .6pt),[approx. value], 
    table.hline(stroke: .6pt),
    [$sqrt(2)$], [#calc.round(calc.sqrt(2), digits: 2)], 
    [$e$], [#calc.round(calc.exp(1), digits: 2)],
    [$pi$], table.cell(fill:green)[#calc.round(calc.pi, digits: 2)], 
)
)<table:irrational_numbers>
