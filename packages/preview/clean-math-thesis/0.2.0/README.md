[Typst](https://typst.app/home/) thesis template for mathematical theses built for simple, efficient use and a clean look.
Of course, it can also be used for other subjects, but the following math-specific features are already contained in the template:

- theorems, lemmas, corollaries, proofs etc.  prepared using [great-theorems](https://typst.app/universe/package/great-theorems)
- equation settings (optionally using [equate](https://typst.app/universe/package/equate))
- pseudocode package [lovelace](https://typst.app/universe/package/lovelace) included.

Additionally, it has headers built with [hydra](https://typst.app/universe/package/hydra).

## Set-Up
The template is already filled with dummy data, to give users an [impression how it looks like](https://github.com/sebaseb98/clean-math-thesis/blob/main/template/main.pdf). The thesis is obtained by compiling `main.typ`.

- after [installing Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) you can conveniently use the following to create a new folder containing this project.
```bash
typst init @preview/clean-math-thesis:0.1.0
```


- edit the data in `main.typ` $\Rightarrow$ `#show template.with([your data])`

#### Parameters of the Template
<ins>personal/subject related information</ins>
- `author`: Name of the author of the thesis.
- `title`: Title of the thesis.
- `supervisor1`: Name of the first supervisor.
- `supervisor2`: Name of the second supervisor.
- `degree`: Degree for which the thesis is submitted.
- `program`: Program under which the thesis is submitted.
- `university`: Name of the university.
- `institute`: Name of the institute.
- `deadline`: Submission deadline of the thesis.

<ins>file paths for logos etc.</ins>
- `uni_logo`: Image, e.g. `image("images/logo_placeholder.svg", width: 50%)`
- `institute_logo`: Image.  

<ins>formatting settings</ins>
- `citation-style`: Citation style to be used in the thesis.
- `body-font`: Font to be used for the body text.
- `cover-font`: Font to be used for the cover text.  

<ins>content that needs to be placed differently then normal chapters</ins>
- `abstract`: Content for the abstract section. 

<ins>equation settings</ins>
- `equate-settings`: either none -> no equate use; or tuple with the settings for the equations (see [docs](https://typst.app/universe/package/equate)), e.g. (breakable: true, sub-numbering: true, number-mode: "label")

<ins>colors</ins>
- `colors`: Color scheme to be used in the thesis. has to be formatted like `(cover-color: rgb("#800080"), heading-color: rgb("#0000ff"))`


#### Other Customizations
- `declaration.typ` should be modified
- when adding chapters, remember to include them into the `main.typ`.
- (optional) change colors and appearance of the theorem environment in the `customization/`-folder.

### Use of the template in existing projects
If you want to change an existing typst project structure to use this template, just type the following lines

```typ
#import "@preview/clean-math-thesis:0.1.0": template

#show: template.with(
  // your user specific data, parameters explained above
)

#include "my_content.typ"  // and eventually more files
```


### Disclaimer 
This template was created after I finished my master's thesis.  
I do not guarantee that it will be accepted by any university, please clarify in advance if it fulfills all requirements. If not, this template might still be a good starting point.

### Acknowledgements
As inspiration on how to structure this template, I used the [modern-unito-thesis](https://typst.app/universe/package/modern-unito-thesis) template. The design is inspired by the [fau-book](https://github.com/FAU-AMMN/fau-book) template.

### Feedback & Improvements
If you encounter problems, please open issues. In case you found useful extensions or improved anything I am also very happy to accept pull requests.
