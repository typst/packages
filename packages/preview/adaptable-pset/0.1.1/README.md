# The `adaptable-pset` Package
<div align="center">Version 0.1.1</div>

This is an easy to use template that can be used to submit school assignments and problem sets. Originally intended for math homeworks, it works great for other subjects like physics and computer science as well. Heavily inspired by [gRox167's now outdated template](https://github.com/gRox167/typst-assignment-template/tree/main), and modernized to take advantage of [showybox](https://typst.app/universe/package/showybox). I've been personally using this template for quite some time, and also shared it among friends and friends of friends to convert to Typst, so I figured it'd be good to make this template publicly available.

## Quick start

Click [here](https://typst.app/app?template=adaptable-pset&version=0.1.1) to get started, or click the "Create project in app" link on the typst universe link to get started easily with this template on the typst webapp.

## Starter code

You can use this to get started, or just use the quick start above for a more detailed template on the webapp

  Let $alpha = sqrt(2+sqrt(2)) in CC$.
  1. Compute $f = min_QQ (alpha)$.
  2. Find $E subset.eq CC$ such that $E$ is the splitting field for $f$ over $QQ$. Compute $|E:QQ|$.
  3. Show that $"Gal"(E\/QQ)$ contains an element of order $4$.
]

1. Consider $alpha^2 - sqrt(2) = 2$. Rearranging, we obtain $alpha^2 = 2 + sqrt(2)$. We thus have $alpha^4 = (2 + sqrt(2))^2 => alpha^4 - 4sqrt(2) -6 = 0$. We can rewrite $4sqrt(2)+6$ in terms of $alpha^2$, obtaining $4sqrt(2) +6 = 4alpha^2 -2$. Therefore $alpha^4 -4 alpha^2 +2$. As such we obtain a potential minimal polynomial $x^4 - 4x^2 +2$. Using Eisenstein's, we see it's irreducible and monic with $alpha$ as a root. Therefore $f = x^4-4x^2+2$. 

2. We can find the roots as $plus.minus sqrt(2+sqrt(2)), plus.minus sqrt(2-sqrt(2))$. We note that because they share the same minimal polymial, $|E:QQ| = deg(min_QQ (alpha)) = 4$, and we have that $E = QQ(sqrt(2+sqrt(2)),sqrt(2-sqrt(2)))$. 

3. Consider the automorphism $sigma in "Gal"(E\/QQ)$ such that $phi(alpha) = beta$, where $beta = sqrt(2-sqrt(2))$. Consider

   $ phi(sqrt(2)) = phi(sqrt(alpha beta)) = phi(alpha^2 - 2) = phi(alpha)^2 - phi(2) = beta^2 - 2  = -sqrt(2) $

   Using this, we see that we can use $sigma$ recursively to obtain $beta, alpha, -alpha, -beta$. We thus show that $sigma$ is an element of order $4$ in $"Gal"(E\/QQ)$. #emoji.heart
