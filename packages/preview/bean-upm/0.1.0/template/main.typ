= Introduction

Hello! This is where your introduction goes. Replace this text with your actual introduction.

You can cite things like this @fakebook2024, and it will appear in your bibliography at the end.

== A Subsection

You can have subsections too. Put your real content here instead of this placeholder text.

Here go some images and tables to show in the lists:

#figure(
  image("assets/placeholder.png", width: 80%),
  caption: [This is my figure caption],
)

#figure(
  image("assets/placeholder.png", width: 80%),
  caption: [This is my figure caption 2],
)

#figure(
  image("assets/placeholder.png", width: 80%),
  caption: [This is my figure caption 3],
)

#figure(
  image("assets/placeholder.png", width: 80%),
  caption: [This is my figure caption 4],
)

#figure(
  table(
    columns: 3,
    [Header 1], [Header 2], [Header 3],
    [Data 1], [Data 2], [Data 3],
  ),
  caption: [This is my table caption],
)

#figure(
  table(
    columns: 3,
    [Header 1], [Header 2], [Header 3],
    [Data 1], [Data 2], [Data 3],
  ),
  caption: [This is my table caption 2],
)
#figure(
  table(
    columns: 3,
    [Header 1], [Header 2], [Header 3],
    [Data 1], [Data 2], [Data 3],
  ),
  caption: [This is my table caption 3],
)
#figure(
  table(
    columns: 3,
    [Header 1], [Header 2], [Header 3],
    [Data 1], [Data 2], [Data 3],
  ),
  caption: [This is my table caption 4],
)


== Lists Work Too
