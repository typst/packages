# Lemmify

Lemmify is a library for typesetting mathematical
theorems in typst. It aims to be easy to use while
trying to be as flexible and idiomatic as possible.
This means that the interface might change with updates
to typst (for example if user-defined element functions
are introduced). But no functionality should be lost.

## Basic Usage

To get started with Lemmify, follow these steps:

1. Import the Lemmify library:
```typst
#import "@preview/lemmify:0.1.1": *
```

2. Define the default styling for a few default theorem types:
```typst
#let (
  theorem, lemma, corollary,
  remark, proposition, example,
  proof, rules: thm-rules
) = default-theorems("thm-group", lang: "en")
```

3. Apply the generated styling:
```typst
#show: thm-rules
```

4. Create theorems, lemmas, and proofs using the defined styling:
```typst
#theorem(name: "Some theorem")[
  Theorem content goes here.
]<thm>

#proof[
  Complicated proof.
]<proof>

@proof @thm[Some thoerem]
```

5. Customize the styling further using show rules. For example, to add a red box around proofs:
```
#show thm-selector("thm-group", subgroup: "proof"): it => box(
  it,
  stroke: red + 1pt,
  inset: 1em
)
```

The result should now look something like this:

## Useful examples

If you do not want to reset the theorem counter on headings
you can use the `max-reset-level` parameter:

```typst
default-theorems("thm-group", max-reset-level: 0)
```

It specifies whats the highest level at which the counter is reset. To manually reset the counter you can use the
`thm-reset-counter` function.

---

By specifying `numbering: none` you can create unnumbered
theorems.

```typst
#example(numbering: none)[
  Some example.
]
```

To make all examples unnumbered you could use the following code:

```typst
#let example = example.with(numbering: none)
```

---

To create other types (or subgroups) of theorems you can use the
`new-theorems` function.

```typst
#let (note, rules) = new-theorems("thm-group", ("note": text(red)[Note]))
#show: rules
```

If you have already defined custom styling you will notice that
the newly created theorem does not use it.
You can create a dictionary to make applying it again easier.

```typst
#let my-styling = (
  thm-styling: thm-styling-simple,
  thm-numbering: ...,
  ref-styling: ...
)

#let (note, rules) = new-theorems("thm-group", ("note": "Note), ..my-styling)
```

---

By varying the `group` parameter you can create independently numbered theorems:

```typst
#let (
  theorem, proof,
  rules: thm-rules-a
) = default-theorems("thm-group-a")
#let (
  definition,
  rules: thm-rules-b
) = default-theorems("thm-group-b")

#show: thm-rules-a
#show: thm-rules-b
```

## Example

```typst
#import "@preview/lemmify:0.1.1": *

#let my-thm-style(
  thm-type, name, number, body
) = grid(
  columns: (1fr, 3fr),
  column-gutter: 1em,
  stack(spacing: .5em, strong(thm-type), number, emph(name)),
  body
)

#let my-styling = (
  thm-styling: my-thm-style
)

#let (
  theorem, rules
) = default-theorems("thm-group", lang: "en", ..my-styling)
#show: rules
#show thm-selector("thm-group"): box.with(inset: 1em)

#lorem(20)
#theorem[
  #lorem(40)
]
#lorem(20)
#theorem(name: "Some theorem")[
  #lorem(30)
]
```

## Documentation

The two most important functions are:

`default-theorems`: Create a default set of theorems
based on the given language and styling.
- `group`: The group id.
- `lang`: The language to which the theorems are adapted.
- `thm-styling`, `thm-numbering`, `ref-styling`: Styling
parameters are explained in further detail in the
[Styling](#styling-parameters) section.
- `proof-styling`: Styling which is only applied to proofs.
- `max-reset-level`: The highest heading level on which
theorems are still reset.

`new-theorems`: Create custom sets of theorems with
the given styling.
- `group`: The group id.
- `subgroup-map`: Mapping from group id to some argument.
The simple styles use `thm-type` as the argument (ie
"Beispiel" or "Example" for group id "example")
- `thm-styling`, `thm-numbering`, 
`ref-styling`, `ref-numbering`: Styling which to apply
to all subgroups.

---

`use-proof-numbering`: Decreases the numbering of
a theorem function by one.
See [Styling](#styling) for more information.

---

`thm-selector`: Returns a selector for all theorems
of the specified group. If subgroup is specified, only the
theorems belonging to it will be selected.

---

There are also a few functions to help with resetting counters.

`thm-reset-counter`: Reset theorem group counter manually.
Returned content needs to added to the document.

`thm-reset-counter-heading-at`: Reset theorem group counter
at headings of the specified level. Returns a rule that
needs to be shown.

`thm-reset-counter-heading`: Reset theorem group counter
at headings of at most the specified level. Returns a rule
that needs to be shown.

### Styling parameters

If possible the best way to adapt the look of theorems is to use show
rules as shown [above](#basic-usage), but this is not always possible.
For example if we wanted theorems to start
with `1.1 Theorem` instead of `Theorem 1.1`.
You can provide the following functions to adapt the look of the theorems.

----
`thm-styling`: A function: `(arg, name, number, body) -> content`, that
allows you to define the styling for different types of theorems.
Below only the `arg` will be specified.

Pre-defined functions
- `thm-style-simple(thm-type)`: **thm-type num** _(name)_ body
- `thm-style-proof(thm-type)`: **thm-type num** _(name)_ body â–¡
- `thm-style-reversed(thm-type)`: **num thm-type** _(name)_ body

---

`thm-numbering`: A function: `figure -> content`, that determines how
theorems are numbered.

Pre-defined functions: (Assume heading is 1.1 and theorem count is 2)
- `thm-numbering-heading`: 1.1.2
- `thm-numbering-linear`: 2
- `thm-numbering-proof`: No visible content is returned, but the
counter is reduced by 1 (so that the proof keeps the same count as
the theorem). Useful in combination with `use-proof-numbering`
to create theorems that reference the previous theorem (like proofs).

---

`ref-styling`: A function: `(arg, thm-numbering, ref) -> content`, to style
theorem references.

Pre-defined functions:
- `thm-ref-style-simple(thm-type)`
  - `@thm -> thm-type 1.1`
  - `@thm[custom] -> custom 1.1`

---
`ref-numbering`: Same as `thm-numbering` but only applies
to the references.

## Roadmap

- More pre-defined styles.
  - Referencing theorems by name.
- Support more languages.
- Better documentation.
- Outlining theorems.
