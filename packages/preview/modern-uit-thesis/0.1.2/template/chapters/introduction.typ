This typst template is intended for use by UiT students to write their Bachelor's or Master's thesis, or any other document requiring a similar format. Although it meets the official requirements set by the UiT, this template is *unofficial*, and students should verify with their supervisor whether it can be used to typeset the thesis or not. The styling and layout for this thesis template has been largely inspired by Erlend Graff's #LaTeX template. #footnote[see #link("https://github.com/egraff/uit-thesis")]

In addition to demonstrating how this template will typeset your content, this document is meant to serve as a helpful reference for how to use its features. The remaining chapters will present a number of useful examples and should be useful for users regardless of their experience with typst.
