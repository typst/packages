# [Social Media References based on Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) Icons for Typst](https://github.com/Bi0T1N/typst-iconic-salmon-svg)
The `iconic-salmon-svg` package is designed to help you create your curriculum vitae (CV). It allows you to easily reference your social media profiles with the typical icon of the service plus a link to your profile.  
The package name is a combination of the acronym *SociAL Media icONs* and the word *iconic* because all these icons have an iconic design (and iconic also contains the word *icon*).

## Features
- Support for popular social media, developer and career platforms
- Uniform design for all entries
- Based on publicly available SVG symbols
- Easy to use
- Allows the customization of the look (extra args are passed to [`text`](https://typst.app/docs/reference/text/text/))
