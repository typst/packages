## 0.5.0

> [!WARNING]
> Starting from Typst v0.12.0 and later, only a single level of indirection
> in the description is supported. This means that the description of an entry
> cannot contain another glossary reference with more than once. See the example
> at
> [`references-in-description`](https://github.com/typst-community/glossarium/blob/master/tests/non-regression/references-in-description.typ)

> [!NOTE]
> Fix `figure.caption` alignement for glossary entries.

> [!NOTE]
> Allow terms to have either `short` or `long` or both.

## 0.4.2

> [!TIP]
> For Typst v0.12.0 and later
> A new function is introduced `register-glossary`.
> Recommended usage is the following:
> ```diff
>  #import "@preview/glossarium:0.4.0": make-glossary, register-glossary, print-glossary, gls, glspl
>  #show: make-glossary
> + #let entry-list = (...)
> + #register-glossary(entry-list)
> ... // Your document body
>  #print-glossary(
> - (
> -   ...
> - )
> +  entry-list
>  )
> ```

> [!TIP]
> An interface for user customization has been provided through parameters in
> `print-glossary`. See the documentation in
> [`advanced-docs`](https://github.com/typst-community/glossarium/blob/master/advanced-docs/main.pdf)
> for more details.

> [!NOTE]
> Deprecate `location` argument in queries

> [!TIP]
> `short` is no longer **required**, but **semi-optional**.
> Accept `short` or `long` for an entry, but not neither.

## 0.4.1

- Resolved an issue causing Glossarium to crash when all entries had a defined, non-empty group.

## 0.4.0

- Support for plurals has been implemented, showcased in [examples/plural-example/main.typ](examples/plural-example). Contributed by [@St0wy](https://github.com/St0wy).
- The behavior of the gls and glspl functions has been altered regarding calls on undefined glossary keys. They now cause panics. Contributed by [@St0wy](https://github.com/St0wy).

## 0.3.0

- Introducing support for grouping terms in the glossary. Use the optional and case-sensitive key `group` to assign terms to specific groups. The appearanceof the glossary can be customized with the new parameter `enable-group-pagebreak`, allowing users to insert page breaks between groups for better organization. Contributed by [indicatelovelace](https://github.com/indicatelovelace).

## 0.2.6

### Added

- A new boolean parameter `disable-back-references` has been introduced. If set to true, it disable the back-references (the page number at the end of the description of each term). Please note that disabling back-references only disables the display of the page number, if you don't have any references to your glossary terms, they won't show up unless the parameter `show-all` has been set to true.
