This package is created by #link("https://github.com/micheledusi")[*Michele Dusi*] and is licensed under the #link("https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html")[GNU General Public License v3.0].

The *name* is inspired by Typst's drawing package #universe("cetz"): it mirrors its sound while hinting at its own purpose: rendering card decks.

All *fonts* used in this package are licensed under the #link("https://openfontlicense.org")[SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1] 
(#link("https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oldenburg")[_Oldenburg_], #link("https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Arvo")[_Arvo_])
or the #link("http://www.apache.org/licenses/")[Apache License, Version 2.0]
(#link("https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab")[_Roboto Slab_]).

The *card designs* are inspired by the standard playing cards, with suit symbols taken from the #link("https://typst.app/docs/img/reference/symbols/emoji/")[emoji library of Typst].

This project owes a lot to the creators of these *Typst packages*, whose work made DECKZ possible:
- #universe("cetz"), for handling graphics and for the name inspiration.
- #universe("suiji") and #universe("digestify"), for random number generation and hashing respectively.
- #universe("linguify"), for localization.
- #universe("mantys"), #universe("tidy"), and #universe("codly"), for documentation.
- #universe("octique") and #universe("showybox"), for documentation styling.

Special thanks to everyone involved in the development of the #link("https://typst.app/about/")[Typst] language and engine, whose efforts made the entire ecosystem possible.
