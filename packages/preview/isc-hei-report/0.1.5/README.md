# ISC report template :scroll:

This is an official template for students reports for the [ISC degree programme](https://isc.hevs.ch/) at the School of engineering in Sion. 

## Using the template

In the `Typst` web application, start with the `isc-hei-report` and voil√† ! Using the CLI, you can initialize the project with the command :

```bash
typst init @preview/isc-hei-report:0.1.5
```

This template will initialize an sample report with sensible default values.

## Installing fonts locally

If you are running `typst` locally, you might miss some of the required fonts. For your convenience, a font download script is included in this repos. As all the fonts are released under the [SIL Open Font License](https://openfontlicense.org/), there are no file inclusion issues here.

To the install the fonts locally in a Linux environment, simply type

```bash
source install_fonts.sh
```

from within the `fonts` directory.

## PDF images inclusion

Unfortunately, `typst` does not support PDF file types inclusion at the time of writing this documentation. As a temporary workaround, PDF files can be converted to SVG via `pdf2svg`.

# Usage

When used locally, creating a PDF is straightforward with the command

```bash
typst compile report.typ
```

Even nicer, the following command compiles the report every time the file is modified.

```bash
typst watch report.typ
```

Another nice possibility is of course to use a VScod[e | ium] via the `Typst LSP` plugin which enables direct compilation.

# Future changes

In the future, several things _might_ be updated, such as :

- [ ] State diagrams and UML diagrams examples
- [ ] Glossary inclusion
- [ ] Master thesis version of this template
- [ ] Themes for code
- [ ] Other nice things
- [x] Appendix
- [x] Acronyms inclusion
- [x] Basic support for including code files


# Questions and help

If you need any help for installing or running those tools, do not hesitate to get in touch with its maintainer [pmudry](https://github.com/pmudry).

You can of course also propose changes using PR or raise issues if something is not clear. Have fun writing reports!
