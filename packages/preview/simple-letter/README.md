Hi there ðŸ‘‹,
thanks for interest in this package. It's my first step for automating my office work. I use this for school-related work.

It exports the function simplePage with the following arguments:
- first unnamed parameter (string): name (or whatever should be on top left)
- second unnamed parameter (string): mail (or whatever should be down left in the corner, if it isn't a mail please see supressMailLink)
- middleText (string): text on top in the middle, optional
- date (bool): date in germand format DD.MM.YYYY, optional
- numbering (bool): page numbering in german format "Seite x von y", optional
- supressMailLink (bool): mail text isn't covered as mailto-link if true, optional

Full example:
```python
simplePage.with("Max Mustmann", "max.mustermann@example.com", middleText: "Example GmbH", date: true, numbering: true, supressMailLink: false)
```

Reach me out if you have quastions!
