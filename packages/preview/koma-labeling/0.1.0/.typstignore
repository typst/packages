# this is not a "standard" ignore file, it's specific to this template's `scripts/package` script
# list any files here that should not be uploaded to Universe when releasing this package

# if you are used to ignore files, be aware that .typstignore is a bit more limited:
# - only this file is used; .typstignore files in subdirectories are not considered
# - patterns must match file/directory names from the beginning: `x.typ` will not match `src/x.typ`
# - `*` in patterns works, but also matches directory separators: `*.typ` _will_ match `src/x.typ`
# .git and .typstignore are excluded automatically
