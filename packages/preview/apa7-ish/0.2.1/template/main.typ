= Introduction

Title of a scientific paper is an important element @teixeira2015importance that conveys the main message of the study to the readers @hartley2019academic.
In this study, we investigate the impact of paper titles on citation count, and propose that the title alone has the highest impact on citation count (#ref(<penguin>)).

A penguin stands on the rock with the height $h$ from the ground.
We parameterize the ejection angle $#sym.theta$ with the initial velocity $\bm{v}=(v_{0x},v_{0y})$ We estimate a flying distance $d$ of the faeces from the origin $O$. Source: #cite(<tajima2020projectiletrajectorypenguinsfaeces>, form: "full")

Using a dataset of 1000 scientific papers from various disciplines, we analyzed the correlation between the characteristics of paper titles, such as length, clarity, novelty, and citation count @li2019correlation. Our results show that papers with clear,
concise, and novel titles tend to receive more citations than those with longer or less informative titles @west2013role.
Moreover, we found that papers with creative and attention-grabbing titles tend to attract more readers and

Our findings suggest that researchers should pay more attention to crafting effective titles that accurately
