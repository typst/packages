= 0155. Min Stack

Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

Implement the `MinStack` class:
- `MinStack()` initializes the stack object.
- `push(val)` pushes the element `val` onto the stack.
- `pop()` removes the element on the top of the stack.
- `top()` gets the top element of the stack.
- `getMin()` retrieves the minimum element in the stack.

You *must* implement a solution with $cal(O)(1)$ time complexity for each function.
