= 0007. Reverse Integer

Given a signed 32-bit integer `x`, return `x` with its digits reversed. If reversing `x` causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range $[-2^31, 2^31 - 1]$, then return $0$.

*Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).*
