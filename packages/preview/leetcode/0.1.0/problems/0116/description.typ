= 0116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node

You are given a *perfect* binary tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children.

Populate each `next` pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the `next` pointer should be set to `none`.

Initially, all `next` pointers are set to `none`.

*Constraints:*

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range $[0, 2^12 - 1]$.
- $-1000 <= "val" <= 1000$

*Follow-up:*

- You may only use constant extra space.
- The recursive approach is fine. You may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.
