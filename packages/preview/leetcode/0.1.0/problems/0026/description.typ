= 0026. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array (Adapted)

- This problem is different from the original version since functions in Typst cannot modify the input array in place.

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

After removing duplicates, return the unique elements in ascending order.
