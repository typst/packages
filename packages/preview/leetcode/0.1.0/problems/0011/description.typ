= 0011. Container With Most Water

You are given an integer array `height` of length $n$. There are $n$ vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the $i$#super[th] line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

*Notice* that you may not slant the container.
