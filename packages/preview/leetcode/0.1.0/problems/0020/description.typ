= 0020. Valid Parentheses

Given a string `s` containing just the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['` and `']'`, determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

+ Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
+ Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
+ Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

- `s` consists of parentheses only `'()[]{}'`.
