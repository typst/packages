# elegant-polimi-thesis ðŸŽ“

Elegant and simple thesis template for [Typst](https://typst.app/), a modern typesetting program alternative to LaTeX. I based the design of the document on the following two templates:

- [PhD Thesis Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/phd-thesis-template/nwjkggvhrzmz)
- [DEIB PhD Thesis Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/politecnico-di-milano-deib-phd-thesis-template/ydsvtyzwxfdk)

They are rather similar. The main difference is the PoliBlu colour spread across the headings. I recommend to check them out.

> [!NOTE]
> See the [manual](docs/manual.pdf) and [documentation](docs/docs.pdf) for more information.
