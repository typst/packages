# Australian Typst Conference Template

## 1. Introduction
This is a template for **academic conference presentations**. It is designed for the use in Typst which is simplier and more user-friendly than LaTeX. 

## 2. How to use this template
themes documents are under **/themes/**

examples documents are under **/examples/**

if you don't want to redesign the template, just follow the typ files under the examples.

## 3. How it looks
The colors are entirely controllable, and I have provided three relatively comfortable color schemes with **green**, **blue**, and **red** as the base tones, which can be easily adjusted.

It is notable, there is a logo displayed in the center of the presentation, and its **appearance**, **transparency**, and **position** can be fully adjusted. Here, I use the University of Sydney's logo as an example.

You could see the PDFs under **examples/xxx.pdf**
