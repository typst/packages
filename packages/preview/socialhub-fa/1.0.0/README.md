# [Social Media References based on Font Awesome for Typst](https://github.com/Bi0T1N/typst-socialhub-fa)
The `socialhub-fa` package is designed to help you create your curriculum vitae (CV). It allows you to easily reference your social media profiles with the typical icon of the service plus a link to your profile.

## Features
- Support for popular social media, developer and career platforms
- Uniform design for all entries
- Based on the Internet's icon library [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- Easy to use
- Allows the customization of the look (extra args are passed to [`text`](https://typst.app/docs/reference/text/text/))

## Fonts Installation
### Linux
1. [Download Font Awesome for Desktop](https://fontawesome.com/download)
2. Unzip the file
3. Switch into the `otfs` folder within the unzipped folder
4. Run `mkdir -p /usr/share/fonts/truetype/`
5. Run `install -m644 'Font Awesome 6 Brands-Regular-400.otf' /usr/share/fonts/truetype/`
6. Unfortunately not all brands are included in the brands font file, so you must also run `install -m644 'Font Awesome 6 Free-Regular-400.otf' /usr/share/fonts/truetype/`
