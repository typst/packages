/// attributes used to guide the layout of the tree

/*
  create attributes for tree nodes
  - input:
    - `forest`: whether this node is the root of a forest
      - if false (default), the children are fitted into `tight`
      - if true, the children are fitted into `band`
    - `fit`: how to calculate the bounding box of this subtree
      - `"tight"` (default): fit subtree tightly with its sibling subtrees
      - `"rectangle"`: fit children in a rectangle with width equal to the widest span of the subtree and height equal to the height of the subtree
      - `"band"`: fit children in a band, i.e., the width is the same as the rectangle fit, but the height is infinite
    - `align-to`: specify the node that this node needs to align to
      - if an index specified, e,g, `0` as the first child, align this node above that child
      - if a string specified
        - `"midpoint"`: align to the midpoint of all children (default)
        - `"first"`: align to the first child
        - `"last"`: align to the last child
        - `"middle"`: align to the middle child (midpoint of the middle two if even number of children)
      - if a ratio specified, e.g. `25%`, align to that percentage point between the first and last child
    - `rotate`: rotate the subtree rooted at this node by the specified angle (counter-clockwise)
  - output: metadata with node attributes
