# TiefLetter: Invoice and Offer Template for Typst

Tiefletter is a template for easily and modularly creating invoices and offers.
It primarily focuses on creating a neat, consistent portfolio in few steps that
are also easily automatable using typst.

Tiefletter is developed by Lena Tauchner (Tiefseetauchner) for her own personal 
use, but it has applications outside that.

## Usage

To use TiefLetter with the Typst web app, choose "Start from template" and select 
TiefLetter. You will also need to include or install the Cormorant Garamond Fonts.

To import the package manually in your Typst project, use:

```typst
#import "@preview/tiefletter:0.1.1": invoice, offer
```

Choose the appropriate document type here, or import letter preset for a simple
letter with custom content. This however is not supported and not adviced, you'll
have to do almost everything manually, including the closing.

Alternatively, you can download the `lib.typ` file and use:

```typst
#import "lib.typ": invoice, offer
```

### Invoice Example

The invoice is the primary template of TiefLetter. It contains an introduction with
a invoice Nr. and a table of the positions including

- Description of the item
- Quantity of the item
- Individual price
- (Optional) VAT Rate per item, defaulting to 20% (can be disabled with is-kleinunternehmer: true)
- (Optional) Total VAT (can be disabled with is-kleinunternehmer: true)
- Total of items including VAT

After the table follows an automatic calculation of the total excluding VAT, the
total VAT charged and the Total including VAT.

Then an optional text, some disclaimers like the Kleinunternehmerregelung as well as a delivery date 
(Lieferdatum/Lieferzeitraum) disclaimer. After those, the payment request, including a (quite handy)
payment QR code.

```typst
#import "@preview/tiefletter:0.1.1": invoice

#invoice(
  invoice-number: "2025-001",
  invoice-date: "07.04.2025",
  seller: (
    name: "Tiefseetauchner",
    address: "Schottenring 12\n1010, Wien",
    uid: "ATUxxxxxxx",
    email: "email-address@example.com",
    tel: "+43 123 456 789",
    is-kleinunternehmer: false,
  ),
  iban: "AT92 1234 1412 1245 3928",
  bic: "XXXXXXXXXXX",
  client: (
    gender-marker: "O",
    full-name: "Muster GesmbH",
    short-name: "Aron Schlosser",
    address: "Liselottenstraße 42c\n6049, Gamsagadorf",
  ),
  items: (
    (quantity: 2, description: "Beispiel 1", unit-price: 400.0),
    (quantity: 1, description: "Beispiel 2", unit-price: 300.0),
    (quantity: 1, description: "Beispiel 3", unit-price: 50.0, vat-rate: 10),
  ),
  payment-due-date: "21.04.2025",
)
```

### Offer Example

The offer is a handy tool to make a consistent public appearance. But simply due to the complexities
of writing offers, it isn't run of the mill, it has to be customized quite heavily.

An offer starts with the usual greeting and introduction, followed by a free text. Then, the same table
as with the invoice (offer does not yet support Kleinunternehmerregelungen), as well as an optional
pre-payment amount. There is also a clause for the validity of the offer, which is generally 30 days, 
but can be set to a certain date.

Closing statement and that's pretty much it.

```typst
#import "@preview/tiefletter:0.1.1": offer

#offer(
  offer-number: "2025-004",
  offer-date: "05.04.2025",
  offer-valid-until: "30.04.2025",
  seller: (
    name: "Tiefseetauchner",
    address: "Schottenring 12\n1010, Wien",
    uid: "ATUxxxxxxx",
    email: "email-address@example.com",
    tel: "+43 123 456 789",
  ),
  client: (
    gender-marker: "F",
    full-name: "Beispiel Kundin",
    short-name: "Maria Musterfrau",
    address: "Beispielstraße 11\n1020, Wien",
  ),
  items: (
    (quantity: 1, description: "Dienstleistung A", unit-price: 500.0),
    (quantity: 2, description: "Beratungseinheit", unit-price: 150.0),
  ),
  offer-text: [Die Dienstleistung A umfasst ......
  
  Außerdem bieten wir eine Beratungseinheit zu ......],
  pre-payment-amount: 20,
)
```

## Configuration Options
