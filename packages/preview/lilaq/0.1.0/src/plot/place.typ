/// Places any type of content in the data area. The coordinates of the origin
/// can be given as data coordinates, as percentage relative to the data area
/// or in absolute lengths (see @rect). 
/// 
/// ```example
/// #lq.diagram(
///   lq.place(0.5, 0.5)[Hello],
///   lq.place(0%, -0.25, align: left)[
///     Text placed at `x: 0%` and `y: -0.25`
///   ]
/// )
/// ```
/// 
/// Unlike other plotting commands, @place is not clipped to the data area by
/// default and the z-index is one higher, making the placed content appear 
/// on top of most other diagram objects. 
/// 
/// ```example
/// #lq.diagram(
///   lq.plot((1, 2, 3), (1, 2.1, 3)),
///   lq.place(
///     10%, 0%, 
///     align: left,
///     box(fill: yellow, inset: 2pt)[
///       Here comes the plotðŸŽ¶ â†“
///     ]
///   )
/// )
/// ```
/// Clipping can be activated via @place.clip and the z-index can be changed
/// through @place.z-index.  
/// 
/// 
/// With @place, a smaller plot can also be placed within another plot. 
/// 
/// ```example
/// #let xs = lq.linspace(-5, 5, num: 20)
/// 
/// #lq.diagram(
///   lq.plot((1,2,3), (1,2,3)),
///   lq.place(25%, 50%,
///     lq.diagram(
///       title: [mini],
///       width: 40pt, height: 30pt, 
///       lq.plot(xs, xs.map(x => x*x))
///     )
///   )
/// )
/// ```
