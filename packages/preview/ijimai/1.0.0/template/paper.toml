bio = "John Doe is a theoretical physicist known for his groundbreaking work in quantum mechanics and black hole thermodynamics. Born in 1975, he developed an early fascination with mathematics and the fundamental laws of the universe. After earning his PhD from MIT, Doe contributed to major advancements in quantum gravity, proposing a novel framework that bridges quantum mechanics and general relativity. His research \"Quantum entanglement\" on entangled particles near event horizons has influenced the study of Hawking radiation."
