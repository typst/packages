/// Default slide function for the presentation.
///
/// - config (dictionary): The configuration of the slide. You can use `config-xxx` to set the configuration of the slide. For more several configurations, you can use `utils.merge-dicts` to merge them.
///
/// - repeat (int, auto): The number of subslides. Default is `auto`, which means touying will automatically calculate the number of subslides.
///
///   The `repeat` argument is necessary when you use `#slide(repeat: 3, self => [ .. ])` style code to create a slide. The callback-style `uncover` and `only` cannot be detected by touying automatically.
///
/// - setting (function): The setting of the slide. You can use it to add some set/show rules for the slide.
///
/// - composer (function, array): The composer of the slide. You can use it to set the layout of the slide.
///
///   For example, `#slide(composer: (1fr, 2fr, 1fr))[A][B][C]` to split the slide into three parts. The first and the last parts will take 1/4 of the slide, and the second part will take 1/2 of the slide.
///
///   If you pass a non-function value like `(1fr, 2fr, 1fr)`, it will be assumed to be the first argument of the `components.side-by-side` function.
///
///   The `components.side-by-side` function is a simple wrapper of the `grid` function. It means you can use the `grid.cell(colspan: 2, ..)` to make the cell take 2 columns.
///
///   For example, `#slide(composer: 2)[A][B][#grid.cell(colspan: 2)[Footer]]` will make the `Footer` cell take 2 columns.
///
///   If you want to customize the composer, you can pass a function to the `composer` argument. The function should receive the contents of the slide and return the content of the slide, like `#slide(composer: grid.with(columns: 2))[A][B]`.
///
/// - bodies (array): The contents of the slide. You can call the `slide` function with syntax like `#slide[A][B][C]` to create a slide.
#let slide = _slide


/// Title slide for the presentation. You should update the information in the `config-info` function. You can also pass the information directly to the `title-slide` function.
///
/// Example:
///
/// ```typst
/// #show: endfield-theme.with(
///   config-info(
///     title: [Title],
///     logo: emoji.city,
///   ),
/// )
///
/// #title-slide(subtitle: [Subtitle], extra: [Extra information])
/// ```
///
/// - config (dictionary): The configuration of the slide. You can use `config-xxx` to set the configuration of the slide. For more several configurations, you can use `utils.merge-dicts` to merge them.
///
/// - extra (string, none): The extra information you want to display on the title slide.
#let title-slide = _title-slide


/// Outline slide for the presentation.
///
/// - config (dictionary): The configuration of the slide. You can use `config-xxx` to set the configuration of the slide. For more several configurations, you can use `utils.merge-dicts` to merge them.
///
/// - title (string): The title of the slide. Default is `utils.i18n-outline-title`.
#let outline-slide = _outline-slide


/// New section slide for the presentation. You can update it by updating the `new-section-slide-fn` argument for `config-common` function.
///
/// Example: `config-common(new-section-slide-fn: new-section-slide.with(numbered: false))`
///
/// - config (dictionary): The configuration of the slide. You can use `config-xxx` to set the configuration of the slide. For more several configurations, you can use `utils.merge-dicts` to merge them.
///
/// - title (string): The title of the slide. Default is `utils.i18n-outline-title`.
///
/// - body (array): The contents of the slide.
#let new-section-slide = _new-section-slide

/// Font configuration helper that can be passed to the theme
///
/// Example:
/// ```typst
/// #show: endfield-theme.with(
///   config-fonts(
///     cjk-font-family: ("Source Han Sans", "Noto Sans CJK"),
///     lang: "zh",
///     region: "cn",
///   ),
/// )
/// ```
#let config-fonts = _config-fonts

/// Focus on some content.
///
/// Example: `#focus-slide[Wake up!]`
///
/// - config (dictionary): The configuration of the slide. You can use `config-xxx` to set the configuration of the slide. For more several configurations, you can use `utils.merge-dicts` to merge them.
