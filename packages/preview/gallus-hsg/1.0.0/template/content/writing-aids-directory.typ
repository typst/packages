In preparing this thesis, I utilized Grammarly for grammar and style correction across the Abstract, Introduction, and Conclusion sections, ensuring clarity and coherence in my writing. I used DeepL to enhance language quality and translate parts of the Literature Review. I used ChatGPT to generate initial drafts and expand on ideas in the Introduction and Discussion sections, providing valuable suggestions and examples. Additionally, I used GitHub Copilot to generate code snippets for the developed functionality and code snippets in the Methodology section.
