First, I'd like to thank coffee for fueling my brain cells and making this thesis possible.

A big shoutout to my advisor for your patience and for not laughing (too hard) at my wild ideas.

To my family, your snack supplies and constant reminders to "just finish it already" were invaluable.

Finally, to my pet, your keyboard sit-ins ensured I took breaks, whether I wanted to or not.
