# `tbl.typ`
This [Typst](https://typst.app/) library facilitates the creation of complex
tables in Typst using a compact syntax based on the `tbl` preprocessor for the
traditional UNIX TROFF typesetting system. There are also some novel features
that are not currently offered by Typst itself, namely:

- Decimal point alignment (using the `decimalpoint` region option and
  `N`-classified columns)
- Columns of equal width (using the `e` column modifier)
- Columns with a guaranteed minimum width (using the `w` column modifier)
- Cells that are ignored when calculating column widths (using the `z` column
  modifier)
- Equation tables (using the `mode: "math"` region option)

Many other features exist to condense common configurations to a concise syntax.

For example:

````
#import "@preview/tbl:0.1.1"
#show: tbl.template.with(box: true, tab: "|")

```tbl
      R | L
      R   N.
software|version
_
     AFL|2.39b
    Mutt|1.8.0
    Ruby|1.8.7.374
TeX Live|2015
```
````

Many other examples and copious documentation are provided in the
[`README.pdf`](https://maxre.es/tbl.typ/v0.1.1.pdf) file.

[The source repository](https://github.com/maxcrees/tbl.typ) also includes a
test suite based on those examples, which can be ran using the GNU `make`
command. See `make help` for details.
