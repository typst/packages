# minimal presentation
A modern minimalistic presentation template ready to use.

## Usage
You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking "Start from template"
on the dashboard and searching for `minimal-presentation`.

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command
```
typst init @preview/minimal-presentation
```

Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you started.

## Configuration
This template exports the `project` function with the following named arguments:

- `title`: The book's title as content.
- `sub-title`: The book's subtitle as content.
- `author`: Content or an array of content to specify the author.
- `aspect-ratio`: Defaults to `16-9`. Can be also `4-3`.

The function also accepts a single, positional argument for the body of the
book.

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the `project`
function in a show rule. If you, however, want to change an existing project to
use this template, you can add a show rule like this at the top of your file:

```typ
#import "@preview/minimal-presentation:0.1.0": *

#set text(font: "Lato")
#show math.equation: set text(font: "Lato Math")
#show raw: set text(font: "Fira Code")

#show: project.with(
  title: "Minimalist presentation template",
  sub-title: "This is where your presentation begins",
  author: "Flavio Barisi",
  date: "10/08/2023",
  index-title: "Contents",
  logo: image("./logo.svg"),
  logo-light: image("./logo_light.svg"),
  cover: image("./image_3.jpg")
)
