# Lineal

IPA: /ËˆlÉªniÉ™l/

Made up of, or having the characteristic of, lines.

Lineal is a Typst template for generating beautifully clean and configurably awesome slides.

## Philosophy

As a long time user of TeX, I have developed and embedded countless LaTeX applications into personal and corporate environments, e.g. automating documentation, conference materials, posters, resumes, etc.

However, LaTeX is showing its age. Compiling a some 30-slide presentation, for instance, takes perhaps a second, and may requires multiple renders to sync TikZ positioning and cross-document referencing. Typst remediates these issues in real-time and with better control and confidence in its data modelling.

Hence, Lineal was born. A professional set of slides produced near instantly, readily equipped with configurable theming and a suite of flexible components.

## Usage

Lineal is available through Typst Universe. Ensure you have installed Typst locally or are familiar with the Typst [web app](https://typst.app/) or the [Tinymist LSP](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=myriad-dreamin.tinymist) extensions for VS Code.

Get started by importing the package and populating your own `/content/<slug>.typ` files:

```typst
#import "@preview/lineal:0.1.0": lineal-theme

#show: lineal-theme.with(
  aspect-ratio: "16-9",
  config-info(
    title: [$bb("L")"ineal"$],
    subtitle: [A Typst slide template],
    author: [Author],
    date: datetime.today(),
    institution: [Institution],
    logo: [Logo],
  ),
)

#title-slide()

#include "content/index.typ"
```

Marking up content is as you would with any other Typst document, where the section (`= <section-title>`) and subsection (`== <slide-title>`) shorthands generate the new section slides with dynamic outline and new tracked slides respectively.
