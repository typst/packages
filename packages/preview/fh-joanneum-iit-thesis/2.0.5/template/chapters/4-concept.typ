  *Hints for formatting in Typst*:

  + You can use built-in styles:
    + with underscore (\_) to _emphasise_ text
    + forward dash (\`) for `monospaced` text
    + asterisk (\*) for *strong* (bold) text

  You can create and use your own (custom) formatting macros:

  + check out the custom style (see in file `lib.typ`):
    + `#textit` for #textit([italic]) text
    + `#textbf` for #textbf([bold face]) text
  ],
