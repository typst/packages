#todo([ Describe the kind of problem at hand? The problem is relevant in which context? What does not work well at the moment? What do people need? Describe the background, the prerequisites for your work. Optionally, add terms and definitions whenever they might not be clear to a fellow student. ])


== Problem Statement

#lorem(25)
#todo([ What is the overall problem? Give examples. Motivate! Compared to existing solutions for the problem at hand, why does someone need a better, faster, and somewhat different solution? ])


== Research Questions

#lorem(25)
#todo([ Focus on one or two main research questions and detail on them. ])



== Hypothesis

#lorem(25)
#todo([ State a hypothesis – a rough idea – of how you think a solution might look like. Explain, how to possibly solve a given problem. ])

== Method

#lorem(25)

#todo([
Describe your structured, academic approach to find — and evaluate — a solution. When you needed (large) data sets for you work, explain how you collected and filtered raw data. For the validation (see Section Evaluation 6) you want to describe the criteria for objective measurement.

  Note the so called "*Roter Faden*": At the end of one chapter you might sum up the content. Then you give an outlook on the next chapter.
  For example, at the end of the introduction you might start the text with:

  _The remainder of the thesis is structured as follows:_
  _The implementation is presented in @implementation (including the backend @backend and the frontend @frontend). The evaluation ...
