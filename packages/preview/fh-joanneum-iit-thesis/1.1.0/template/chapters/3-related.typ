Describe the work of other research teams and noteworthy approaches related to your work. State what is different to your solution.

+ Related literature might/should contain: theoretical foundations,
  - definitions of key terms,
  - technologies, techniques,
  - and/or a literature review

+ Note on the size and quality of your bibliography:
  - BA about 30-40 references
  - MA about 60-100 references

Furthermore, check:
Are the reference (too) old?
Did you include papers from scientific databases, such as ACM or IEEE?
Can the reader find your sources? (e.g. check if you named the publisher for books, or specified DOIs for scientific papers)

*Citation hints when writing in Typst:*


A single citation is possible with the \@Eco:2010 (i.e. using the _at_ sign), such as @Eco:2010.
Find in #cite(<acm:diglibrary>) and/or #cite(<ieee:xplore>) the lateset scientific findings. For citing multiple references, just name them one by one, such as #cite( <Alley:1998>) #cite(<Booth:2008>)
@Batina:2011
@Eco:2010
@Fernandez-Mir:2011
@Field:2003
@Google:2016a @Google:2017a
@Li:2008
@Shaw:2002
@Strunk:2000
@Wisconsin:2004
@Yin:2013
@Zobel:2004
 and they will be listed within the _(_ _)_ round brackets separated by a _;_ semicolon.

If we know where a text of relevance is presented inside an article, we might specify the page number also, see @Yin:2013[p.~7]. If you want to cite without paranthesis, you specify _form_ as _prose_, as shown here with #cite(<Shaw:2002>, form: "prose").
