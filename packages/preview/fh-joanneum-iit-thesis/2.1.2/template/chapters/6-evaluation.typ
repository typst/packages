#todo([
  Describe (proof) how your implementation really solved the stated problem. I.e.
  accept or reject your hypotheses. Provide a range of input data sets. Run
  experiments and gather the output (of tools) to meter your prototype. For the
  analysis, collect the measurement-data, process (e.g. filter) data and interpret
  the data. Include an interpretation of the work. What do the results mean to
  you? State current limitations of your solution. Give (personal) interpretation
  where suitable. Your own opinion is relevant, but must be marked clearly as
  such.

  == Setup Experiment <setup>

  #lorem(35)#v(0.5cm)

  *For example*: During the setup the #gls("gc") was configured for the parallel version
  using the value `+UseParallelGC` for the command line argument `-XX` (`java -XX:+UseParallelGC`).

  *Hints on dynamically reading in external data for tables in Typst:*

  Using the custom macro `fhjtable` it is possible to include data dynamically for
  table generation. The data has to be specified in #gls("csv")
  as shown below:

  == Measurement <measure>

  #lorem(35)#v(0.3cm)

  *Hints on using tables in Typst:*

  Somewhere in the normal text of the thesis the interpretation of data and
  information shown in a table must be discussed. Explain to the readers which
  numbers are important. Possibly, highlight unexpected or special data points.

#figure(
  table(
    columns: (auto, 4em, 4em, 4em, 4em), inset: 10pt, fill: (x, y) =>
    if y == 0 { luma(240) }, stroke: gray, align: center, [], [*Min*], [*Max*], [*$diameter$*], [*$sigma$*], [Network roundtrip time], [34.6s], [42.5s], [38.1s], [2.3s], [Time for single request], [2.4s], [13.5s], [*7.1s*], [4.3s],

      and standard deviation $sigma$ of the 273 measured network times in seconds.],
    [Roundtrip and request times.],
  ),
) <nwperf>


#todo([
  For example: ... @nwperf shows some calculated results on the roundtrip and
  request times measured in the experiment. The average, the minimum, the maximum
  and the standard deviations hint to a dramatic increase (> 13%) in performance
  in comparison to the old solution of 2003.

  == Interpretation of the Data <measure>

  #lorem(35)#v(0.3cm)


  *For example*: The customisation of the #gls("gc") seem to have following positive and negative
  consequences....


  *Hints on dynamic calculation in Typst:*

  We might calculate, e.g. `#calc.max(...)`, within our document, such as max of
  three and seven times two is: #calc.max(3, 2 * 7).

  *Hints on using logic in Typst:*

  For example, we might use *for loop* to arrange a few images in a grid box, as
  shown below.
])

#box(height: 132pt, columns(2, gutter: 11pt)[
  #for x in range(1, 3) [
    #let imagename = "/figures/chart-" + str(x) + ".svg"
    #figure(image(imagename, width: 75%), caption: [
      Compared source code by metric #(x).
    ])

*Hints on Charts:*

Note: the charts (*vector*! images) shown have been created from raw data using
the tool *gnuplot* on the command line. With `gnuplot` you can create charts by
use of a textual command language. This is great for automation and it is also
great for managing the source code in `git`.
