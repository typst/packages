# Simple Technical Resume
<div align="center">Version 0.1.0</div>

A simple technical resume template designed to fit within a page and work well with ATS. Inspiration was taken from [Jake's Resume](https://github.com/jakegut/resume/) and [sb2nov's Resume](https://github.com/sb2nov/resume/).

I created this Typst template because I was maintaining 8 resumes over LaTEX and making formatting/alignment changes took forever to achieve over all the LaTEX files (over 2-3 hours of endless trial & error). It took me over 30+ hours to create a perfectly formatted resume in 1 page (in LaTEX, using MikTex), being as dense as possible, while keeping margins barely visible. I had received positive feedback about the readibility of the resume and it was ATS-friendly as well. When I found about Typst, I was tempted to create a similar resume in Typst with the added benefit of maintenance being easier and templating being possible (unlike LaTEX).

# Quickstart
A bare-bones template to start making your resume is given below:

#let github = "dwight-schrute"
#let linkedin = "dwight-schrute"
#let personal-site = "dwightschrute.com"

// you can remove/comment any argument to fallback to the preset value and/or
// remove it.
