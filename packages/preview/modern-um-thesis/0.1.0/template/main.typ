= Math And Citations <math-and-citations>

== Math <math>

=== Numbers and Units <numbers-and-units>

Numbers and units support are provided by `unify`:

- #num("12 345.678 90")
- #num("0.3e45")
- #unit("kg m s^-1")
- #unit("um") $unit("um")$
- #unit("ohm") $unit("ohm")$
- #qty("0.13", "mm")
- #numrange("10", "20")
- #qtyrange("10", "20", "celsius")

Typst also has special syntax and library functions to typeset mathematical formulas.

- $1 plus.minus 2 ii$
- $1.654 times 2.34 times 3.430$

=== Mathematical Symbols And Formulas <mathematical-symbols-and-formulas>

According to @ISO_math, an explicitly defined function not depending on the context is printed in upright type, e.g. $sin$, $exp$, $ln$, $Gamma$.

While mathematical constants, the values of which never change, are printed in upright type, e.g. $ee = num("2.718281828") dots$; $ppi = num("3.141592") dots$; $ii^2 = -1$.

Well-defined operators are also printed in upright type, e.g. $div$, $partial$ in $partial x$ and each $dif$ in $(dif f)/(dif x)$.

Formulas should be centered on a new line. Each formula should be numbered sequentially by chapter, with the number aligned to the right.

$ ee^(ii ppi) + 1 = 0 $

$ (dif^2 u)/(dif t^2) = integral f(x) dif x $

The end of the formula needs punctuation, whether a comma or a period, depending on the following sentence.

$
  (2h)/ppi integral_0^infinity sin(omega delta)/omega cos(omega x) dif omega
  = cases(
    h", " & abs(x) < delta ",",
    h/2", " & x=plus.minus delta",",
    0", " & abs(x) > delta "."
  )
$

When the formula is long, it is best to break the line at the equal sign "=".

$
    & I(X_3; X_4) - I(X_3; X_4 | X_1) - I(X_3; X_4 | X_2) \
  = & [I(X_3; X_4) - I(X_3; X_4 | X_1)] - I(X_3; X_4 | accent(X, tilde)_2) \
  = & I(X_1; X_3; X_4) - I(X_3; X_4 | accent(X, tilde)_2).
$

If breaking the line at the equal sign is difficult to achieve, you can also break the line at the $+$, $-$, $times$, $div$ operators. When breaking the line, the operator should only be written in front of the broken line and not repeated.

$
  1/2 Delta(f_(i j)f^(i j)) = 2(sum_(i<j) chi_(i j) (sigma_i - sigma_j)^2 + f^(i j) gradient_j gradient_i (Delta f)\
    + gradient_k f_(i j) gradient^k f^(i j) + f^(i j) f^k [2 gradient_i R_(j k) - gradient_k R_(i j)]).
$

=== Theorems <theorems>

`Theorion` is used in this template to set up environments for theorems, lemmas, and propositions.

@theorem is an example for a theorem:

#theorem(title: [Residue theorem])[
  Let $U$ be a simply connected open subset of the complex plane containing a finite list of points $a_1, dots, a_n, U_0 = U without {a_1, dots, a_n}$ and a function $f$ holomorphic on $U_0$. Letting $gamma$ be a closed rectifiable curve in $U_0$, and denoting the residue of $f$ at each point $a_k$ by $"Res"(f, a_k)$ and the winding number of $gamma$ around $a_k$ by $upright(*I*)(gamma, a_k)$, the line integral of $f$ around $gamma$ is equal to $2 ppi ii$ times the sum of residues, each counted as many times as $gamma$ winds around the respective point:

  $
    integral.cont_gamma f(z) dif z
    = 2 ppi ii sum_(k=1)^n upright(I)(gamma, a_k) "Res"(f, a_k).
  $

  If $gamma$ is a positively oriented simple closed curve, $upright(I)(gamma, a_k)$ is 1 if $a_k$ is in the interior of $gamma$ and 0 if not, therefore

  $
    integral.cont_gamma f(z) dif z
    = 2 ppi ii sum "Res"(f, a_k).
  $

  with the sum over those $a_k$ inside $gamma$.

  Proof of @theorem.

  #proof[
    First, according to ...\
    Next, we have ...\
    Finally, ...
  ]
] <theorem>

== Notation Of References <notation-of-references>

= Illustrations <illustrations>

The term _illustrations_ refers to informational material that illustrates and enhances the text. Figures, Maps, and tables are all examples of illustrations and are either inserted throughout the text, appearing as soon as possible after the references to them have been made, or grouped at the end of each chapter. Whichever method you choose, you must use it consistently for all the figures, tables, or other illustrations included.

== Figures <figures>

Figures may include photographs (original or photocopied), charts, diagrams, graphs, and drawings. If original photographs are used, they must be included in both copies. They must all be listed in the preliminary pages in a List of Figures. Figure numbers and captions appear below the figure.

Typst has a built-in `figure` function for inserting figures, which supports various image formats, including PNG, JPEG, PDF, and SVG.

=== Single Figure <single-figure>

A simple example of inserting a single figure is shown in @fig:single-figure.

#figure(
  canvas({
    import draw: *

    let csv_data = csv("assets/energy-distrib.csv", row-type: dictionary)
    let points = csv_data.map(row => (float(row.radial), float(row.energy)))
    let style = (stroke: none, fill: black)

    plot.plot(
      size: (9, 6),
      x-label: [$r$ (#unit("mm"))],
      y-label: [Energy (#unit("W/m^3"))],
      x-min: 0,
      x-max: 7,
      y-min: -1000,
      y-max: 11000,

      {
        plot.add(points, mark: "square", style: style)
        plot.annotate(
          content((2.4, 4000), $q_v=(sigma omega^2 abs(bf(A))^2)/2$),
        )
      },
    )
  }),
  caption: [Energy distribution as a function of radial distance.],
) <fig:single-figure>

=== Multiple Figures <multiple-figures>

#let subfig(body) = {
  canvas({
    import draw: *
    set-style(stroke: 0.4pt)

    rect((0, 0), (4, 3), name: "border", fill: gray)
    line("border.north-west", "border.south-east")
    line("border.north-east", "border.south-west")
    line("border.north", "border.south")
    line("border.east", "border.west")
    content("border.center", text(size: 2cm, font: "Noto Sans")[#body])
  })
}

A simple example of inserting multiple figures is shown in @fig:multiple-figures-single-numbering. These two horizontally aligned subfigures share a single figure counter and do not have individual subfigure titles.

#figure(
  grid(
    columns: (1fr, 1fr),

    subfig("A"), subfig("B"),
  ),
  caption: [Caption],
) <fig:multiple-figures-single-numbering>

If the figures are independent and do not share a common figure counter, then you can use the `grid` function, as shown in @fig:multiple-figures-multiple-numbering-a and @fig:multiple-figures-multiple-numbering-b.

#grid(
  columns: (1fr, 1fr),
  [#figure(
    subfig("A"),
    caption: [Caption for figure A],
  ) <fig:multiple-figures-multiple-numbering-a>],
  [#figure(
    subfig("B"),
    caption: [Caption for figure B],
  ) <fig:multiple-figures-multiple-numbering-b>],
)

If you want to create a single figure with multiple subfigures, you can use the `subfigure` function, as shown in @fig:multiple-figures-subfig-numbering-a and @fig:multiple-figures-subfig-numbering-b.

#figure(
  grid(
    columns: (1fr, 1fr),

    subfigure(
      subfig("A"),
      caption: [Caption for figure A],
      label: <fig:multiple-figures-subfig-numbering-a>,
    ),
    subfigure(
      subfig("B"),
      caption: [Caption for figure B],
      label: <fig:multiple-figures-subfig-numbering-b>,
    ),
  ),
  caption: [Caption for subfigures A and B],
) <fig:multiple-figures-subfig-numbering>

== Tables <tables>

=== Basic Tables <basic-tables>

Tables contain information placed in a columnar arrangement and are the only illustrations numbered and captioned above.

An example of a simple three line table is shown in @tab:simple.

#figure(
  table(
    columns: 3,

    toprule,
    table.header(
      table.cell(
        colspan: 2,
      )[Item],
      table.hline(end: 2, stroke: 0.05em),
      [],
      [Animal],
      [Description],
      [Price (\$)],
    ),
    midrule, [Gnat], [per gram],
    [13.65], [], [each],
    [0.01], [Gnu], [stuffed],
    [92.50], [Emu], [stuffed],
    [33.33], [Armadillo], [frozen],
    [8.99], bottomrule,
  ),
  caption: [An elegant three-line table],
) <tab:simple>

=== Complex Tables <complex-tables>

_To be implemented_

== Algorithms <algorithms>

_To be implemented_

== Code Blocks <code-blocks>

Though Typst has built-in support for code blocks, it is recommended not to put large blocks of code directly in the thesis document. If necessary, you can use the `codly` package to insert code blocks with syntax highlighting.

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
int main() {
  pid_t pid;
  switch ((pid = fork())) {
    case -1:
      printf("fork failed\n");
      break;
    case 0:
      /* child calls exec */
      execl("/bin/ls", "ls", "-l", (char*)0);
      printf("execl failed\n");
      break;
    default:
      /* parent uses wait to suspend execution until child finishes */
      wait((int*)0);
      printf("is completed\n");
    break;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

= Conclusion <conclusion>

= Maxwell Equations <maxwell-equations>


For the two-dimensional case, the polarization vectors are as follows:
$
  bf(E) = E_z(r, theta) hat(bf(z)),
$
$
  bf(H) = H_r(r, theta) hat(bf(r)) + H_theta(r, theta) hat(bold(theta)).
$ <polarization-vectors>

Taking the curl of @eqt:polarization-vectors:
$
  nabla times bf(E) = 1 / r (partial E_z) / (partial theta) hat(bf(r)) - (partial E_z) / (partial r) hat(bold(theta)),
$
$
  nabla times bf(H) = [1 / r partial / (partial r) (r H_theta) - 1 / r (partial H_r) / (partial theta)] hat(bf(z)).
$

Since $macron(macron(mu))$ is diagonal in cylindrical coordinates, the curl of the electric field $bf(E)$ in Maxwell's equations is:
$
  nabla times bf(E) = upright(i) omega bf(B),
$
$
  1 / r (partial E_z) / (partial theta) hat(bf(r)) - (partial E_z) / (partial r) hat(bold(theta)) = upright(i) omega mu_r H_r hat(bf(r)) + upright(i) omega mu_theta H_theta hat(bold(theta)).
$

Therefore, the components of $bf(H)$ can be written as:
$
  H_r = 1 / (ii omega mu_r) 1 / r (partial E_z) / (partial theta),
$
$
  H_theta = 1 / (ii omega mu_theta) 1 / r (partial E_z) / (partial r).
$

Similarly, since $macron(macron(epsilon.alt))$ is diagonal in cylindrical coordinates, the curl of the magnetic field $bf(H)$ in Maxwell's equations is:
$
  nabla times bf(H) = -ii omega bf(D),
$
$
  [1 / r partial / (partial r) (r H_theta) - 1 / r (partial H_r) / (partial theta)] hat(bf(z)) = -ii omega macron(macron(epsilon.alt)) bf(E) = -ii omega epsilon.alt_z E_z hat(bf(z)),
$
$
  1 / r partial / (partial r)(r H_theta) - 1 / r (partial H_r) / (partial theta) = -ii omega epsilon.alt_z E_z.
$

From this, we obtain the wave equation for $E_z$:
$
  1 / (mu_theta epsilon.alt_z) 1 / r partial / (partial r) (r (partial E_z) / (partial r)) + 1 / (mu_r epsilon.alt_z) 1 / r^2 (partial^2 E_z) / (partial theta^2) + omega^2 E_z = 0.
$

= Flow Charts <flow-charts>

The `fletcher` package provides support for creating diagrams with arrows, including flow charts shown in @fig:flow-chart#footnote()[https://github.com/Jollywatt/typst-fletcher/blob/main/docs/readme-examples/2-flowchart-trap.typ] and state diagrams shown in @fig:state-diagram#footnote()[https://github.com/Jollywatt/typst-fletcher/blob/main/docs/readme-examples/3-state-machine.typ].
