The story begins with a note from the narrator written in Classical Chinese, describing his reunion with an old friend.
Having heard that the friend's brother was ill, he visits them, but discovers that the brother has recovered and taken up an official post.
The rest of the story consists of 13 fragments the narrator has copied from a diary the brother kept while "mad", written in vernacular Chinese.

The diary reveals that he suffered a "persecution complex", and became suspicious of everyone's actions, including people's stares, a doctor's treatment, his brother's behavior, and even dogs barking.
He came to believe that the people in his village had a grudge against him and were cannibals who carried the intent of consuming him.
Reading a history book, the "madman" saw the words "eat people" written between the lines, as commentary placed in classical Chinese texts.
As his "madness" progressed, he experiences psychosis thinking the villagers are attempting to force him into suicide, that his brother ate his sister and that he might have done so as well.
He attempts to persuade the villagers to "change from the heart", but concludes that people have been eating each other for millennia.
The last chapter concludes with a plea to "save the children".
