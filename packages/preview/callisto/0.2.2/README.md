# Callisto

A Typst package for reading from Jupyter notebooks. It currently addresses the following use cases:

- Extracting specific cell sources and cell outputs, for example to include a plot in a Typst document.

- Rendering a notebook in Typst (embedding selected cells or the whole notebook).

## Quick start

The examples below illustrate the basic functionality. For more information see

-  the [tutorial](docs/Tutorial.md),
-  the [function reference](docs/Reference.md).

```typst
#import "@preview/callisto:0.2.2"

// Render whole notebook
#callisto.render(nb: json("docs/example.ipynb"))

// Render code cells named/tagged with "plots", showing only the cell output
#callisto.render(
   "plots",
   nb: json("docs/example.ipynb"),
   cell-type: "code",
   input: false,
)

// Get functions preconfigured to use this notebook
#let (render, Cell, In, Out) = callisto.config(
   nb: json("docs/example.ipynb"),
)

// Render the first 3 cells using the plain template
#render(range(3), template: "plain")

// Render only cell among the first two that is of type "code"
#Cell(range(2), cell-type: "code")

// Render cell with execution number 4.
// Compared to `render`, `Cell` checks there's only one match.
// (It could make sense to set `count` globally with `config()`.)
#Cell(4, count: "execution")

// Render separately the input and output of cell "plot2"
// The cell defines its label "plot2" in a header at the top of the cell:
// #| label: plot2
#In("plot2")
#Out("plot2")

// Use notebook template for code inputs, custom template for markdown cells
#let repr-template(cell, ..args) = repr(cell.source)
#render(template: (input: "notebook", markdown: repr-template))

// Get more functions preconfigured for this notebook
#let (display, result, source, output, outputs) = callisto.config(
   nb: json("docs/example.ipynb"),
)

// Get the result of cell with label "some-code"
#result("some-code")

// Get the source of cell "plot1" as raw block
#source("plot1")

// This doesn't work: cell "plot1" produces a display but no result!
// #result("plot1")

// Get the display output of that cell
#display("plot1")

// Force using the PNG version of this output
#display("plot1", format: "image/png")

// Get the output (display or result, we don't care) of some cells
#output("some-code")
#output("plot1")

// This doesn't work: "plot2" has two outputs!
// #output("plot2")

// Get first and last output of "plot2"
#output("plot2", item: 0)
#output("plot2", item: -1)

// Get all outputs as an array
#outputs("plot2")

// Change the width of an image read from the notebook
#{
   set image(width: 100%)
   output("plot1")
}

// Another way to do the same thing
#image(output("plot1").source, width: 100%)
```

The manual call to `json(...)` is currently required to avoid issues with relative file paths between the user root and the package root. This should be solved once Typst gets a `path` type.

## Design

The API is centered on the following main functions:

- `render`: takes a cell specification and returns content for the selected cells, rendered using the selected template.

- `sources`: takes a cell specification and returns raw blocks with the cell sources. The raw block can be used as as content. Alternatively, the source text and source language can be accessed as fields.

- `outputs`: takes a cell specification and returns cell outputs of the desired type (result, displays, errors, streams).

The function parameters are described in detail in the [function reference](docs/Reference.md).

The cell specification can be a cell index, execution count, tag, ID, metadata label, user-defined cell field or filter function. Code cells can start with header lines of the form `#| key: value`. When a notebook is processed, header lines are used to define corresponding fields in the cell metadata, and are removed from the cell source.

For convenience, many additional functions are derived from the main functions by preconfiguring some of their parameters. For example, `render` has `Cell`, `In` and `Out` as preconfigured aliases to render a single cell, either in entirety (`Cell`) or just the input or output (`In` and `Out`). And `outputs` has aliases such as `results` and `displays` to get an array of results or displays for the selected cells.

Most aliases have a singular and a plural form, e.g. `result` and `results`: the singular form will return a single value (which can often be used directly as content), while a plural form always returns an array. By default the singular form also checks that there is a single value to return: for example `result("figure1")` will raise an error if the call matches more than one cell.

All the functions can be further preconfigured by calling `config`, which returns a dict of preconfigured functions. This is most commonly used to set the notebook for all functions, but can also be used for any parameter such as the rendering template or the preferred image formats.


## Markdown and LaTeX rendering configuration

By default Markdown and LaTeX are rendered using [cmarker](https://github.com/SabrinaJewson/cmarker.typ) and [mitex](https://github.com/mitex-rs/mitex). These cannot (yet) render everything.

The Markdown and LaTeX processing can be configured by changing the handlers for `text/markdown` and `text/latex`. For example to get working rendering of image files references in Markdown, the following can be used:

   ```typ
   #import "@preview/cmarker:0.1.3"
   #import "@preview/mitex:0.2.5": mitex

   #callisto.render(
     nb: "notebook.ipynb",
     handlers: (
       "text/markdown": cmarker.render.with(
           math: mitex,
           scope: (image: (path, alt: none) => image(path, alt: alt)),
       ),
     ),
   )
   ```

(This should become unnecessary once Typst adds a `path` type for file paths.)
