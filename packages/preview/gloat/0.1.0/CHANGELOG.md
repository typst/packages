<!-- Describe the feature set of the initial release here -->

The following functions are included in the original `gloat` package:

- The `cv` function creates a header with name and contact information.
- The `edu` function displays formatted degrees for an education section.
- The `exp` function displays formatted work/research experience.
  It can also be used to showcase projects: simply input the project name into the `org` parameter.
- The `ser` function displays examples of service to the field.
  For extended volunteer experience, it may be more appropriate to use the `exp` function.
- The `award` function is used to list awards, fellowships, and grants.
- The `abstract` function formats an entry for a conference abstract, following the ACS style guide.
- The `paper` function formats an entry for a paper in the ACS format.
- The `pres` function formats an entry for a conference presentation in the ACS style.

The initial release also includes a template for getting started.
