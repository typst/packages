All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [v0.4.0](https://github.com/ljgago/typst-chords/compare/v0.3.0...v0.4.0) - 2024-07-09

### Added

- New `background` parameter, now in `chart-chord`, `piano-chord` and `single-chord`. Add a background color on the chord name.
- New `position` parameter in `chart-chord`, `piano-chord`. Now the chart can be below or above of the chord name.
- New `..text-params` in `chart-chord`, `piano-chord` and `single-chord`. It embeds the native text parameters from the standard library of typst.

### Changed

- Renamed `new-chart-chords`, `new-piano-chords` and `new-single-chords` functions by `chart-chord`, `piano-chord` and `single-chord` removing the closure functions. Use the [with](https://typst.app/docs/reference/foundations/function/#definitions-with) property for preset the parameters.
- Renamed `style` parameter by `design` to avoid name collision with the native text parameters. The possible values of `design` are `"sharp"` and `"round"`
- Renamed `fill` parameter by `fill-key` to avoid name collision with the native text parameters.
- Replaced the `styles-measure` syntax by the new [context-measure](https://typst.app/docs/reference/context/) added in Typst v0.11.0.
- Refactored the render and the graphic objects, now each object calculates its own relative position.

### Removed

- Removed `size` as a specific parameter. `size` is included in the native *text* parameters in `..text-params`.

## [v0.3.0](https://github.com/ljgago/typst-chords/compare/v0.2.0...v0.3.0) - 2024-03-01

### Changed

- Renamed `frets` parameter by `frets-amount`.
- Renamed `fret-number` parameter by `fret`.
