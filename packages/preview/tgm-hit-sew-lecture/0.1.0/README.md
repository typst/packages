# TGM HIT lecture document ("Skriptum") template

This is an opinionated template created for programming-focused subjects at the information technology department at TGM in Vienna. It is not branded, so can be reused for other institutions, but it is not specifically prepared to support that.

## Getting Started

Using the Typst web app, you can create a project by e.g. using the "Create new project in app" button on the package's [Universe page](https://typst.app/universe/package/tgm-hit-sew-lecture).

To work locally, use the following command:

```bash
typst init @preview/tgm-hit-sew-lecture
```

## Usage

The template ([rendered PDF](example.pdf)) contains usage examples as example content. If you are looking for the details of this template package's function, take a look at the [manual](docs/manual.pdf).
