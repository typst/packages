# VUB Typst huisstijl

An unofficial template to get the look of the [Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB)](https://www.vub.be) huisstijl in Typst based on [this LaTeX template](https://gitlab.com/rubdos/texlive-vub)

## Getting Started

You can choose "Start from template" in the web app, and search for `vub-huisstijl`.

If you are running Typst locally, you can use the following command to initialize the template:

```shell
typst init @preview/stv-vub-huisstijl:0.1.0
```

### Fonts

The package makes use of the "TeX Gyre Adventor" font, with "Roboto" as a fallback. These should be installed for the title page to look right. They are available for free, and also come bundled with texlive.

## Note

This only provides a template for a thesis title page, not for slides. That can be added in the future.

## About the name

St V ([Saint Verhaegen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Verhaegen)) is an important part of the folklore of the VUB and the ULB.
