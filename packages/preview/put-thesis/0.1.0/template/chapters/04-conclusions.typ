= Conclusions <chap:conclusions>

The conclusions to the thesis, also called Closing remarks, should contain the
authors' assessment of the tasks indicated in #link(<chap:intro>)[the
	Introduction chapter], and especially the assessment of the objectives and
the scope of work that they outlined. It is important that the planned or
hypothesized outcomes are compared with the results which were actually
obtained. This approach facilitates a clear diagnosis of the number of realized
goals and brings attention to the results achieved by the authors through their
own work.

Following #link(<chap:conclusions>)[Conclusions], the authors may find it
appropriate to enclose additional information in form of appendices (e.g.
tables containing more detailed numerical results, short programs, etc.)
