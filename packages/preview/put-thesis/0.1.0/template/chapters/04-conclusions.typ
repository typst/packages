= Conclusions <chap:conclusions>

The conclusions to the thesis, also called Closing remarks
(pl. #text(lang: "pl")[_"Zakończenie"_, _"Uwagi końcowe"_, _"Podsumowanie"_,
	etc.]), should contain the authors' assessment of the tasks indicated in
#link(<chap:intro>)[the Introduction chapter], and especially the assessment of
the objectives and the scope of work that they outlined. It is important that
the planned or hypothesized outcomes are compared with the results which were
actually obtained. This approach facilitates a clear diagnosis of the number of
realized goals and brings attention to the results achieved by the authors
through their own work.

After #link(<chap:conclusions>)[Conclusions], the authors may find it
appropriate to disclose additional information in Appendices (e.g. tables
containing more detailed numerical results, short programs, etc.)
