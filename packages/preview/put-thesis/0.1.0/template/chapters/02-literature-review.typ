= Literature review <chap:literature>

A theoretical chapter -- literature review shedding some light onto the current
state of knowledge on the topic.

Literature review comprises in-depth summaries of relevant works in the field.
The discussed resources must be cited and jointly listed near the end of the
thesis in Bibliography (or References, or similar). All positions listed in
Bibliography must be referenced at least once within the body of the thesis (no
"orphaned" references allowed). *Do not include references in the page footer.*

It is mandatory to cite the sources of all the information present in the
thesis. This includes figures, tables, source code snippets, etc. In the case
of information taken from the Internet, the relevant web page addresses must
also be included.

Typst has native support for LaTeX's \*.bib format for bibliography files, so
you may use them freely. As of version 0.13.0, the support for bibliography
styles is limited, so it is usually best to just use one of the provided
defaults (e.g. "ieee").
