= Own work <chap:own-work>

This is where one or more chapters must document the original work done by the
authors -- from the idea and the methodology used to solve the problem, to
technical descriptions of the solution -- formal documentation, conducted
tests, research and the final results.

This part must contain pieces of original work done by the authors, adequate to
their practical knowledge acquired during their studies. "Original work" can be
understood as e.g.: the creation of a software application or a part of it,
proposal of an algorithm to solve a particular problem, the design of a
computer system or network, analysis and evaluation of new technologies or
solutions used in the industry, etc.

The authors are expected to provide a full documentation of their work. The
documentation should specify problem constraints or assumptions. It should also
recall what method was used to complete every task, along with an evaluation
and description of encountered problems. In the case of implementation-focused
works, this section is replaced by a technical documentation and a user's
documentation for the developed system or program.

*Do not include the full source code* of the developed solutions inside the
body of the thesis. Any software written for the purpose of the thesis, or
results of experiments, should be uploaded to the PUT online repository or
shared via a medium, e.g. a CD disk, as an addition to the
work#footnote[Uploading and linking to online services such as GitHub is also
  acceptable.].

== Writing style

Passive mode is preferred#footnote[Remarks on the style of writing partially
  originate from the web pages of prof. Maciej Drozdowski~@Drozdowski2006.],
i.e. "... was considered", "... was implemented", and not: "I considered ...",
"I implemented ...". References to earlier parts should be written as follows:
"As mentioned earlier, ...", "As shown above, ...". Avoid long sentences.

Informal language is strictly prohibited. It is imperative to use well-defined,
precise terminology that carries clear meaning.

Directly copying and pasting from external sources is strictly prohibited as
plagiarism#footnote[How to identify and avoid plagiarism (in Polish):
  https://akademickaporadniaprawna.pl/plagiat-na-studiach/] and proof of
intellectual indolence of the authors. Each matter should be described using
the authors' own words, and sources should be cited.
