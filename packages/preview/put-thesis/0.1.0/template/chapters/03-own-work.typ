= Own work <chap:own-work>

"Own work" is a a very informal title that should be redacted to whatever makes
sence for a particular thesis.

In general, this is where one or more chapters must document the original work
done by the authors -- from the idea and the methodology used to solve the
problem, to technical descriptions of the solution -- formal documentation,
conducted tests, research and the final results.

The work must contain pieces of original work done by the authors, adequate to
their practical knowledge acquired during their studies. "Original work" can be
understood as e.g.: creation of a software application or a part of it,
proposal of an algorithm to solve a particular problem, design of a computer
system or network, analysis and evaluation of new technologies or solutions used
in the industry, etc.

The authors are expected to include a full documentation of their work,
including any made assumptions and the method of realization of each task, along
with an evaluation and description of encountered problems. In the case of
implementation-focused works, this section is replaced by a technical
documentation and a user's documentation of the developed system or program.

*Do not include the full source code* of the developed solutions inside the body
of the thesis. Any software written for the purpose of the thesis, as well as
results of experiments, should be uploaded to the PUT online repository or
shared via a medium, e.g. a CD disk, as an addition to the
work#footnote[Uploading and linking to online services such as GitHub is also
	acceptable.].

== Writing style

Passive mode is preferred#footnote[Remarks on the style of writing partially
	originate from the web pages of prof. Maciej Drozdowski~@Drozdowski2006.],
i.e. "... was considered", "... was implemented", and not: "I considered ...",
"I implemented ...". References to earlier parts should be written as follows:
"As mentioned earlier, ...", "As shown above, ...". Avoid long sentences.

Informal language is strictly prohibited. It is imperative to use well-defined,
precise terminology that carries clear meaning.

Directly copying & pasting from external sources is strictly prohibited as
plagiarism and proof of intellectual indolence of the authors. Each matter is to
be described using the authors' own words. It is sometimes necessary to cite
external sources.
