# put-thesis-typst

An unofficial Typst template for writing a thesis for Poznań University of
Technology. Based on
[PUT Dissertation Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/put-dissertation-template/dpqxdndmgkpg)
by Dawid Weiss, Marta Szachniuk and Maciej Komosiński (2022), as well as
[Jak pisać prace dyplomowe - uwagi o formie](http://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/mdrozdowski/dyd/txt/jak_mgr.html)
by prof. Maciej Drozdowski (2006).

The template supports Bachelor's and Master's theses, in Polish or English. It
was adapted from a template for the faculty of Computing and Telecommunications
(WIiT), but it attempts to be as unopinionated as possible, and should be easily
adjustable to any faculty or field of study.

## Usage
Copy the provided template and work from there.
