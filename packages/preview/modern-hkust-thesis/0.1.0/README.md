Typst is a next-generation typesetting system, designed as a modern alternative to LaTeX. Written in Rust, it offers the advantages of user-friendly syntax and fast compilation.

This template was created by me for my own graduation project, and it meets [all the formatting requirements of HKUST-GZ](https://fytgs.hkust-gz.edu.cn/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Guidelines-on-Thesis-Preparation.pdf).
If you find it useful, you can [buy me a ☕️ coffee here](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jwangl5). Thanks! ☺️
