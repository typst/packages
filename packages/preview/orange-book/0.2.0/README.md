# orange-book
A book template inspired by The Legrand Orange Book of Mathias Legrand and Vel https://www.latextemplates.com/template/legrand-orange-book.

## Usage
You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking "Start from template"
on the dashboard and searching for `orange-book`.

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command
```
typst init @preview/orange-book
```

Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you started.

## Configuration
This template exports the `book` function with the following named arguments:

- `title`: The book's title as content.
- `subtitle`: The book's subtitle as content.
- `author`: Content or an array of content to specify the author.
- `paper-size`: Defaults to `a4`. Specify a [paper size
  string](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/page/#parameters-paper) to
  change the page format.
- `copyright`: Details about the copyright or
  `none`.

The function also accepts a single, positional argument for the body of the
book.

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the `book`
function in a show rule. If you, however, want to change an existing project to
use this template, you can add a show rule like this at the top of your file:

```typ
#import "@preview/orange-book:0.1.0": book

#show: book.with(
