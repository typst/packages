  We would like to thank Lennart Andersson for his feedback on this template.

  We would also like thank Camilla Lekebjer for her contribution on this template, as well as Magnus Hultin for his popular science summary class and example document.

  Thanks also go to the following (former) students for helping with feedback and suggestions on this template: Mikael Persson, Christoffer Lundgren, Mahmoud Nasser.

First of all, this document is a Typst version of MScTemplateCS by Flavius Gruian and Camilla Lekebjer, which can be found at #link( "https://bitbucket.org/flavius_gruian/msccls/src/master/")[bitbucket/flavius_gruian]. Having found typst.app some time before writing our Master's thesis, we were just not willing to go back to LaTeX due to its slow compile times and non-intuitive styling, justifing the creation of this Typst template. The following text is straight up copied from the original LaTeX template for sake of comparison. If you want to see a practical example we used this template for our master's thesis which can be found at #link("https://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/record/9185623")[https://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/record/9185623].

This document describes the Master’s Thesis format for the theses carried out
at the Department of Computer Science, Lund University.
Your abstract should capture, in English, the whole thesis with focus on the
problem and solution in 150 words. It should be placed on a separate right-hand
page, with an additional 1cm margin on both left and right. Avoid acronyms,
footnotes, and references in the abstract if possible.
Leave a 2cm vertical space after the abstract and provide a few keywords rel-
evant for your report. Use five to six words, of which at most two should be from
the title.
