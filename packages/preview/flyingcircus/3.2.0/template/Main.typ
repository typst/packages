  The project to build the first armoured attack vehicle in the Gotha Empire spanned nearly three decades. Largely
  considered a low priority during the war with the UWF, the fierce fighting against the Macchi Republics suddenly
  accelerated the project, which went from concept sketch to deployment in six short months.
   
  This development was accompanied by intense secrecy: the project was code-named “Wandering Castle”, which gave the
  impression it was a Leviathan-building enterprise.
   
  Used for the first time in the Battle of Reggiane in 1593, the Type 1 reflects the idea that the tank ought to be a sort
  of mobile form of the concrete pillboxes coming into use at the time. Though suffering frequent breakdowns, plagued with
  difficulties getting its main gun on target, and very vulnerable in the mountains, it was successful enough that it soon
  became the most-produced tank of the war.
   
  After the first six months the official name of the vehicle was changed from its codename to “Self-Propelled Assault
  Vehicle Type 1”, known by the acronym “SbRd-AnZg Ausf I”. This development was ignored by everyone outside of official
  communications.

  Though remembered for large bombardment ships and airship tenders, the majority of the Seeheer was in fact these
  mid-sized frigates. These ships were designed for patrolling the seas for enemy airships and to escort Macchi cargo
  ships along the coast. They proved a deadly threat to landing barge attacks in the Caproni islands, as it was found
  their anti- aircraft guns were also effective against surface targets.
