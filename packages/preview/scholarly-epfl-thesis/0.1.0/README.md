# EPFL Thesis template

Adaptation of [an unofficial LaTeX template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/swiss-federal-institute-of-technology-in-lausanne-epfl-phd-thesis/dhcgtppybcwv) to Typst.

A complete example is shown in the [example folder](https://github.com/augustebaum/epfl-thesis-typst/blob/v0.1.0/example); see [example.pdf](https://github.com/augustebaum/epfl-thesis-typst/blob/v0.1.0/example/main.pdf) for the rendered PDF. The document structure can of course be adapted to your needs.

## Usage

You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking "Start from template" on the dashboard and searching for `epfl`.

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command

```sh
typst init @preview/scholarly-epfl-thesis
```

Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you started.

This template uses certain fonts, including Utopia Latex for most text. If the font is not available to Typst, as is the case in the Typst Web App, then the template will fall back to a default font. The font is included in example shown in the Github repository [here](https://github.com/augustebaum/epfl-thesis-typst/blob/v0.1.0/example/utopia_font), otherwise you can download it however you like.

### Configuration

This template exports the `template` function with the following named arguments:

- `title`: The work's title. Default: `[Your Title]` 
- `author`: The author's name. Default: `"Your Name"` 
- `paper-size`: The work's [paper size](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/page#parameters-paper). Default: `"a4"` 
- `date`: The work's date. Unused for now. Default: `none` 
- `date-format`: The format for displaying the work's date. By default, the date will be displayed as `MMMM DD, YYYY`. Unused for now. Default: `[month repr:long] [day padding:zero], [year repr:full]` 

The template will initialize your package with a basic call to the `template` function in a `show` rule. If you, however, want to change an existing project to use this template, you can add a show rule like this at the top of your file:

```typst
#import "@preview/scholarly-epfl-thesis:0.1.0": *

#show: template.with(
  title: [Your Title],
  author: "Your Name",
  date: datetime(year: 2024, month: 03, day: 19),
)

// Your content goes below.
```

Also included are the `front-matter`, `main-matter` and `back-matter` helpers which you can use in `show` rules in your document to change certain settings when they are called: e.g. reset the page numbering when main matter starts, or number headings with letters in the back matter.
See [example/main.typ](https://github.com/augustebaum/epfl-thesis-typst/blob/v0.1.0/example/main.typ) for example usage.

## Development

In order for Typst to access the Utopia Latex font, you need to include it your font path. I've included the font in `example/` so that you can run this in your shell:
```sh
cd example
typst w main.typ --font-path .
```
See [here](https://typst.app/docs/reference/text/text/#parameters-font) for more about the font path.

## Credits
- The creators of the [ILM template](https://github.com/talal/ilm/blob/main/lib.typ) for the page layout, header and README format which I drew heavily from
- The creators of the [original LateX template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/swiss-federal-institute-of-technology-in-lausanne-epfl-phd-thesis/dhcgtppybcwv)

## TODO

- [ ] Hide header and page number on empty pages
  - Tracking issue: <https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/2722>
  - [ ] Quick fix: <https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/2722#issuecomment-1911150996>
    - Tried it, when I put it in the `show heading.where(level: 1)` it disrupts the outline. I guess it would work if you put in the `metadata` manually before each chapter.
  - Optionally don't force an empty page
- [ ] Table of contents
    - [ ] Join abstracts into one outline entry
      - I removed the lines for the German and French abstracts so it takes less space, but it's not exactly the same as the original which has a custom outline entry
    - [ ] Style
      - [ ] Space between heading number and heading
      - [ ] Level 1 Headings are bold and don't have dot lines between the heading and the page number
      - <https://sitandr.github.io/typst-examples-book/book/snippets/chapters/outlines.html>
      - `outline.entry` can't be modified easily because the arguments are positional
        - I found a solution on discord but it strips away the links. I tried putting in a `link` manually but that gets formatted like a link in the text, which is not what we're looking for.
          - A solution to that link issue can be found in this thread: <https://discord.com/channels/1054443721975922748/1231526650462736474>
      - I might use <https://typst.app/universe/package/outrageous>
    - [x] Include list of figures and tables
- [ ] Figures
    - [ ] Subfigures
        - tracking issue: <https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/246>
        - A wip: <https://github.com/tingerrr/subpar>
        - A quickfix: <https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/246#issuecomment-1928735969>
          - Works if you abuse the `kind` mechanic, but I can't get the superfigure's caption centered
    - [x] Short caption for table of contents
        - <https://sitandr.github.io/typst-examples-book/book/snippets/chapters/outlines.html>
    - [x] Numbering
        - i-figured?
- [ ] Chemistry examples?
- [ ] CV?
- [x] Spacing after heading is different depending on if we're in frontmatter or main matter
- [x] Cover page should take its values from the template arguments
  - cover page is separate from template, given that it is not meant to be printed anyways
    - this also reflects how the latex template works
- [x] Spacing before new sub-heading
- [x] Readme
  - [x] How-to
  - [x] Screenshots
  - [x] Thumbnail
- [x] Refactor to `front-matter`, `main-matter`...
- [x] Numbering
    - [x] Why are pagenumbers bold on certain pages?
        - There was a show rule that inserted a pagebreak before each chapter. This produced a bug where the chapter start pages was inconsistent with the information Typst has.
    - [x] numbering starts on acknowledgements (or somewhere else?)
- [x] Equations
  - [x] Numbering
    - <https://sitandr.github.io/typst-examples-book/book/snippets/math/numbering.html>
  - [x] Align left
    - Why did `pad` work and not `h`?
- [x] page numbers are too low in the page
- [x] First-line indent for front matter
  - <https://typst.app/docs/reference/model/par/#parameters-first-line-indent>
  - Actually this looks unintentional?
- [x] Appendices
- [x] Margins
- [x] Tables
    - [x] Style
