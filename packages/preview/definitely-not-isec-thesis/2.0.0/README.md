# ISEC Master's Thesis Template

An unofficial ISEC TUGraz Master's Thesis template

Author: Ernesto Martínez García <[ecomaikgolf.com](https://ecomaikgolf.com)>

> [!NOTE]
> If you are an ISEC or TUGraz employee and want it renamed to `isec-thesis` or
> `tugraz-thesis` I would need an approval to allocate the name :)

## Design

Template closely follows [Maria's LaTeX
Template](https://extgit.isec.tugraz.at/castle/student/templates/master-thesis/-/tree/main/thesis)
design from the institute.

There's a few differences between the original and the Typst version that won't
be changed as I prefer as it is here. Nothing reallty important, just small
typesetting/design choices. Check the reported differences
[here](https://github.com/ecomaikgolf/typst-iaik-master-thesis-template/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adiff)
