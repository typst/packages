The graph illustrates how individuals with limited knowledge tend to overestimate their abilities (peak of "Mount Stupid"), while those gaining expertise experience decreased confidence (valley of despair) before reaching sustained mastery.],
) <fig:dunning-kruger>

As illustrated in @fig:dunning-kruger, the Dunning-Kruger effect demonstrates a cognitive bias wherein individuals with low ability at a task overestimate their competence. This phenomenon has significant implications for self-assessment and learning processes in academic and professional contexts.
