# vercanard

A colorful resume template for Typst.

# What does it look like?

The [demo](template/main.typ) file showcases what it is possible to do.
You can see the result in [the corresponding PDF](demo.pdf).

# Quick usage guide

First of all, copy the template to your Typst project, and import it.

```typst
#import "@preview/vercanard:1.0.0": *
```

Then, call the `resume` in a global `show` rule function to use it.
This function takes a few arguments that we explain in comments below:

```typst
#show: resume.with(
  // The title of your resume, generally your name
  name: "Your name",
  // The subtitle, which is the position you are looking for most of the time
  title: "What you are looking for",
  // The accent color to use (here a vibrant yellow)
  accent_color: rgb("f3bc54"),
  // the margins (only used for top and left page margins actually,
  // but the other ones are proportional)
  margin: 2.6cm,
  // The content to put in the right aside block
  aside: [
    = Contact

    // lists in the aside are right aligned
    - #link("mailto:example@example.org")
    - +33 6 66 66 66 66
  ]
)

// And finally the main body of your resume can come here
```

When writing the body, you can use level-1 headings as section titles,
and format an entry with the `entry` function (that takes three content
blocks as arguments, for title, description and details).
