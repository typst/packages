This package provides a Brainfuck-to-Typst transpiler.
Letâ€™s unpack this mouthful gibberish.
_Brainfuck_ is a minimalist esoteric programming language that consists of only eight simple instructions yet is Turing-complete (which essentially  means everything computable by a fully-fledged language on a computer is in principle computable by it and vice versa).
A _transpiler_ is a program that translates a program given in a certain programming language to an equivalent program in another language.
In our case the package takes a program written in Brainfuck and translates it into Typst code, which can then be displayed or run (evaluated); for example:

```typ
#import "@preview/brain-transplant:0.1.0": *

#raw(brain-transplant("+++++++[->,.<]", input: "Hi Mom!", evaluate: true))
```

The output is:

```
Hi Mom!
```

All this has no real practical use, but itâ€™s very amusing (mindbogglingly so even ðŸ¤¯) if youâ€™re into programming, minimalism, recreational and artistic use of math and technology, formal rules, meta and the like.

## ðŸ“– The manual

Using <span style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #239dad">brain transplant</span> is quite straightforward.
A [**comprehensive manual**](./docs/manual.pdf) covers:

- Introductory background.
- How to use the provided function (`brain-transplant()`).
- Example Brainfuck programs and their outputs.

## ðŸ“¦ Other Typst packages by me

I really like Typst, its structure, its community and the freedom and accessibility it brings to writing packages (compared to LaTeX). Another package I wrote is:
