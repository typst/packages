# ttt-lists


`ttt-lists` is a *template* to create class lists and belongs to the [typst-teacher-tools-collection](https://github.com/jomaway/typst-teacher-templates).



## Usage 

Run this command inside your terminal to init a new list. 

```sh
typst init @preview/ttt-lists my-student-list
```

This will scaffold the following folder structure.

```asci
my-student-list/
├─ students.csv
└─ students.typ
```

Edit the `students.csv` file or replace it with your own. Modify the `students.typ` to your liking or leave as is and then run `typst compile students.typ` to create a beautiful list.
