> [!IMPORTANT]
> This template is an unofficial community template and may not be accepted by the university.
>
> Although this template attempts to replicate the Word template, there may still be many formatting issues. See [Known Issues](#known-issues) for details.

> [!NOTE]
> Other templates are provided in the `other/` folder, for example:
> 
> 1. Lab report template (lab-report.typ)
> 2. Master/PhD proposal template (master-proposal.typ)
> 
> These templates are not integrated into the `thesis` template yet. To use them, clone the repository (or copy the file locally).
> Note these files may reference resources in `other` and `asset`; please download those as well.

## Usage

First, learn how to write with Typst (you don't need to write functions). It's simple — see the [tutorial](https://typst-doc-cn.github.io/docs/tutorial/writing-in-typst/) for a quick start.

The template can be used locally or imported as a package:

```typ
#import "@preview/modern-nenu-thesis:0.1.1": thesis
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need to download the Lisu font (隶书) from [here](https://github.com/dolbydu/font/blob/master/unicode/Lisu.TTF) (for macOS/Linux).

### Local usage

1. Install a text editor — VS Code is recommended — and add the Tinymist Typst and Typst Preview extensions.

- Clone/download this repository and open the project folder in VS Code.

- Open the `template/thesis.typ` file and start writing your thesis. In VS Code you can press <C-K> V (Ctrl+K V) to open the preview pane and see live rendering.

## Known Issues

1. When using `subpar`, subfigure numbering cannot be displayed correctly, as shown below:
![subfigure-error](images/subfigure-error.png)
Therefore subfigures are currently not supported.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> There is a workaround discussed in [Issue #12](https://github.com/RubixDev/typst-i-figured/issues/12).

2. Author signature cannot be directly inserted as an image/PDF on the title page.
