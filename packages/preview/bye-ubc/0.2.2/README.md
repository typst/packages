# UBC Thesis Template

A Typst template for theses at the University of British Columbia.

## Quick Start

To get started quickly, the easiest way is to run the following command in your
terminal:

```bash
typst init @preview/bye-ubc <dir>
```

This will create a new Typst project in the specified `<dir>` directory with the
UBC thesis template.
