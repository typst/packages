  abstract = {The past 3 years of work in NLP have been characterized by the development and deployment of ever larger language models, especially for English. BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.},

  abstract = {The 5-layer TCP and 7-layer OSI models are taught as high-level frameworks in which the various protocols that are used in computer networks operate. These models provide valid insights in the organization of network functionalities and protocols; however, the difficulties to fit some crucial technologies within them hints that they don't provide a complete model for the organization of -- and relationships between -- different mechanisms in a computer network. Recently, a recursive model for computer networks was proposed, which organizes networks in layers that conceptually provide the same mechanisms through a common interface. Instead of defined by function, these layers are distinguished by scope. We report our research on a model for computer networks. Following a rigorous regime alternating design with the evaluation of its implications in an implementation, we converged on a recursive architecture, named Ouroboros. One of our main main objectives was to disentangle the fundamental mechanisms that are found in computer networks as much as possible. Its distinguishing feature is the separation of unicast and broadcast as different mechanisms, giving rise to two different types of layers. These unicast and broadcast layers can easily be spotted in today's networks. This article presents the concepts underpinning Ouroboros, details its organization and interfaces, and introduces the free software prototype. We hope the insights it provides can guide future network design and implementation.},

  abstract = {There is a need for timer-based mechanisms (in addition to retransmission timers) to achieve reliable connection management in transport protocols designed to operate in a general network (datagram and internetwork) environment where packets can get lost, duplicated, or missequenced. This need is illustrated by discussing the timer mechanisms or assumptions (1) in the Department of Defense Transmission Control Protocol, initially designed using only a message exchange mechanism; and (2) in the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory Delta-t protocol, designed explicitly to be timer based. Some of the implementation and service implications of the approaches are discussed. The bounding of maximum packet lifetime and related parameters is important for achieving transport protocol reliability and a mechanism is outlined for enforcing such a bound.},
