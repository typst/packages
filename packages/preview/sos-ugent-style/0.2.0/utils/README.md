# Scope of 'utils'
Some functions are very interesting in most dissertations or documents,
but should not be part of a general UGent template.
At the moment, they can be found in this directory.
See [lib.typ](lib.typ) for all exported utilities.

## Researched Typst Universe packages
This file also contains some research on the various Typst packages useful for
a dissertation (I did the work, why not write it down?).
Some categories are described here.

### Mathematics packages
Only one option: use `physica`.
Just use directly in your dissertation, no use putting it here in utils.
~~It is showcased in the examples directory.~~

### Glossary packages
Synonyms:
- glossary (a list of words used in the text with a definition),
- abbreviations (a list of abbreviations to the full meaning),
  - acronyms (a subset of abbreviations, there are also initialisms and other
    categories), ...
They are synonyms in the sense that packages mostly do both of them.

After my review (see ðŸ‘‡), I think **glossy** is *the* best package at the
moment and missing features should be added there. That is also why glossy
is [thightly integrated](../src/utils/README.md) into sos-ugent-style. Because
of the glossy architecture, even this integration remains pretty lightweight.

I reviewed most glossary packages on Typst Universe:  
Hot:
Package          | Remarks
-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------
**glossy**       | Based on 'glossarium', but easier syntax
abbr             | Can contain [content], instead of stringifying everything
acrostiche       | Same, can contain [content]. Contains a lot of commands (downside)

Not:
                 |
-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------
glossarium       | Inspiring, but glossy (fork) has superior usability. Does references Dherse. (**previously used**)
gloss-awe        | unmaintained on Universe
leipzig-glossing | too advanced, for linguistics
acrotastic       | outdated, amateuristic fork

### Theorem packages
