> [!warning]
> This package contains the symbols from Tabler Icons, but has no association with the Tabler.io team themselves.

Despite the bad naming (the name is translated Table icons, which is only one character away from Tabler icons), this package implements a couple of functions to allow the use of Tabler.io Icons (https://tabler.io/icons) in your documents.

> [!warning]
> Webfonts (css and ttf, which are used by the python script) have been moved to the paid tier, meaning updates to this package will be less. While it is sad, I do understand, why they would monetize the end product (they still give away the raw icons for free).
