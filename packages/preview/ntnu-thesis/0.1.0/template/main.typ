= Introduction
<introduction>
The original `ntnuthesis` template was created by the CoPCSE #footnote[#link("https://www.ntnu.no/wiki/display/copcse/Community+of+Practice+in+Computer+Science+Education+Home")] as a template applicable for theses at all study levels. 
It is closely based on the standard LaTeX `report` document class as well as previous thesis templates. This typst port aims to replicate the look of the LaTeX template in typst.

The purpose of the present document is threefold. It should serve (i) as
a description of the document class, (ii) as an example of how to use
it, and (iii) as a thesis template.

= Using the Template
<chap:usage>
== Thesis Setup
<sec:setup>
The document class is initialized by calling
```typst #show: ntnu-thesis.with()``` at the beginning of your `.typ` file. Currently it only supports english. The `ntnu-thesis` function has a number of options you can set, most of which will be described in this document. The rest will be documented in this templates repository. 

The titlepage at the beginning of this document is a placeholder to be used when writing
the thesis. This should be removed before handing in the thesis, by settting `titlepage: false`.
Instead the official NTNU titlepage for the corresponding thesis type
should be added as described on Innsida.#footnote[see #link("https://innsida.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/English/Finalizing+the+bachelor+and+master+thesis") for bachelor and master, and #link("https://innsida.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/English/Printing+your+thesis")
for PhD.]

== Title, Author, and Date
<title-author-and-date>
The title of your thesis should be set by changing the `title` parameter of the template. The title will appear on the titlepage as well as in the running header of the even numbered pages. If the title is too long for the header, you can use `shorttitle` to set a version for the header.

The authors should be listed with full names in the `authors` parameter. This is an array, with multiple authors separated by a comma. 

Use `date` to set the date of the document. It will only appear on
the temporary title page. To keep track of temporary versions, it can be
a good idea to use `date: datetime.today()` while working on the thesis.

== Page Layout
<page-layout>
The document class is designed to work with twosided printing. This
means that all chapters start on odd (right hand) pages, and that blank
pages are inserted where needed to make sure this happens. However,
since the theses are very often read on displays, the margins are kept
the same on even and odd pages in order to avoid that the page is
jumping back and forth upon reading. 

By default this is turned off. You can turn it on by setting
`chapters-on-odd: false` at the top of the file.

== Structuring Elements
<structuring-elements>
The standard typst headings are supported, and are set using =.

=== This is a level 3 heading
<this-is-a-subsection>

==== This is level 4 heading
<this-is-a-subsubsection>

===== This is a level 5 heading
<this-is-a-paragraph>

Headings up to level 3 will be included in the table of
contents, whereas the lower level structuring elements will not appear
there. Don’t use too many levels of headings; how many are appropriate,
will depend on the size of the document. Also, don’t use headings too
frequently.

Make sure that the chapter and section headings are correctly
capitalised depending on the language of the thesis, e.g.,
'#emph[Correct Capitalisation of Titles in English];' vs. '#emph[Korrekt
staving av titler på norsk];'.

Simple paragraphs are the lowest structuring elements and should be used
the most. They are made by leaving one (or more) blank line(s) in the
`.typ` file. In the typeset document they will appear indented and with
no vertical space between them.

== Lists
<lists>
Numbered and unnumbered lists are used just as in regular typst, but are typeset
somewhat more densely and with other labels. Unnumbered list:

- first item

- second item

  - first subitem

  - second subitem

    - first subsubitem

    - second subsubitem

- last item

Numbered list:

+ first item

+ second item

  + first subitem

  + second subitem

    + first subsubitem

    + second subsubitem

+ last item


== Figures
<figures>
Figures are added using ```typst #figure()```. An example is shown in
#link(<fig:mapNTNU>)[2.1];. By default figures are placed in the flow, exactly where it was specified. To change this set the ```placement``` option to either `top`, `bottom`, or `auto`. To add an image, use ```typst #image()``` and set the `height` or `width` to include the graphics file. If the caption consists of a single sentence fragment (incomplete sentence), it should not be punctuated.


#figure(image("figures/kart_student.png", width: 50%),
caption: [
    The map shows the three main campuses of NTNU.
  ]
)
<fig:mapNTNU>

For figures compsed of several sub-figures, the `subpar` module has been used. See #link(<fig:subfig>)[2.4]
with #link(<sfig:a>)[\[sfig:a\]] for an example.

#subfigure(
  figure(image("figures/kart_student.png", width: 100%),
    caption: [First sub-figure]), <sfig:a>,
  figure(image("figures/kart_student.png", width: 100%),
    caption: [Second sub-figure]), <sfig:b>,
    columns: (1fr, 1fr),
   caption: [A figure composed of two sub-figures. It has a long caption in order to demonstrate how that is typeset.
  ],
<fig:subfig>
    
)

== Tables
<tables>
Tables are added using ```typst #table()```, wrapped in a ```typst #figure()``` to allow referencing. An example is given in
@tab:example1. If the caption consists
of a single sentence fragment (incomplete sentence), it should not be
punctuated.


#figure(
  table(
    stroke: none,
    columns: 2,
    table.hline(),
    table.header([*age*], [*IQ*],),
    table.hline(),
    [10], [110],
    [20], [120],
    [30], [145],
    [40], [120],
    [50], [100],
    table.hline(),
  ), caption: [A simple, manually formatted example table]
  ) <tab:example1>
Tables can also be automatically generated from CSV files #footnote(link("https://typst.app/docs/reference/data-loading/csv/")).

== Listings
<listings>
Code listings are are also wrapped in a ```typst #figure()```. Code listings are defined by using three ``` `backticks` ```. The programming language can also be provided. See the typst documentation for details. The
code is set with the monospace font, and the font size is reduced to
allow for code lines up to at least 60 characters without causing line
breaks. If the caption consists of a single sentence
fragment (incomplete sentence), it should not be punctuated.

#figure(caption: "Python code in typst")[
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(0, 1)
y = np.sin(2 * np.pi * x)

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()
```
]<lst:python>
#figure(caption: "C++ code in typst")[
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
  return 0;
}
```]<lst:cpp>


== Equations
<equations>
Equations are typeset as normally in typst. It is common to consider
equations part of the surrounding sentences, and include punctuation in
the equations accordingly, e.g.,
$ f (x) = integral_1^x 1 / y thin d y = ln x thin . $ <logarithm>
For more advanced symbols like, e.g., $grad, pdv(x,y)$, the `physica` module is preloaded.
As you can see, the simple math syntax makes typst very easy to use.
== Fonts
<fonts>
Charter at 11pt with the has been selected as the main font for the thesis template. For code examples, the monospaced font should be used – for this, a scaled
version of the DejaVu Sans Mono to match the main font is preselected. 

== Cross References
<sec:crossref>
Cross references are inserted using `=` in typst. For examples on usage, see @sec:crossref in @chap:usage, @tab:example1
@fig:mapNTNU, @logarithm,
@lst:cpp and #link(<app:additional>)[Appendix A];. 



== Bibliography
<bibliography>
The bibliography is typeset as in standard typst. It is added in the initializing function as such: ```typst bibliography: bibliography("thesis.bib")```.
With this setup, using `@` will give a number
only~@landes1951scrutiny, and ```typst #cite(, form: "prose") ``` will give author and number like this: #cite(<landes1951scrutiny>, form: "prose");.


== Appendices
<appendices>
Additional material that does not fit in the main thesis but may still
be relevant to share, e.g., raw data from experiments and surveys, code
listings, additional plots, pre-project reports, project agreements,
contracts, logs etc., can be put in appendices. Simply issue the command
```typst #show: appendix``` in the main `.typst` file, and then the following chapters become appendices. See #link(<app:additional>)[Appendix A]
for an example.

= Thesis Structure
<thesis-structure>
The following is lifted more or less directly from the original template.

The structure of the thesis, i.e., which chapters and other document
elements that should be included, depends on several factors such as the
study level (bachelor, master, PhD), the type of project it describes
(development, research, investigation, consulting), and the diversity
(narrow, broad). Thus, there are no exact rules for how to do it, so
whatever follows should be taken as guidelines only.

A thesis, like any book or report, can typically be divided into three
parts: front matter, body matter, and back matter. Of these, the body
matter is by far the most important one, and also the one that varies
the most between thesis types.

== Front Matter
<sec:frontmatter>
The front matter is everything that comes before the main part of the
thesis. It is common to use roman page numbers for this part to indicate
this. The minimum required front matter consists of a title page,
abstract(s), and a table of contents. A more complete front matter, in a
typical order, is as follows.

/ Title page\:: #block[
The title page should, at minimum, include the thesis title, authors and
a date. A more complete title page would also include the name of the
study programme, and possibly the thesis supervisor(s). See
#link(<sec:setup>)[2.1];.
]

/ Abstracts\:: #block[
The abstract should be an extremely condensed version of the thesis.
Think one sentence with the main message from each of the chapters of
the body matter as a starting point.
#cite(<landes1951scrutiny>, form: "prose") have given some very nice
instructions on how to write a good abstract. A thesis from a Norwegian
Univeristy should contain abstracts in both Norwegian and English
irrespectively of the thesis language (typically with the thesis
language coming first).
]

/ Dedication\:: #block[
If you wish to dedicate the thesis to someone (increasingly common with
increasing study level), you may add a separate page with a dedication
here. Since a dedication is a personal statement, no template is given.
Design it according to your preference.
]

/ Acknowledgements\:: #block[
If there is someone who deserves a 'thank you', you may add
acknowledgements here. If so, make it an unnumbered chapter.
]

/ Table of contents\:: #block[
A table of contents should always be present in a document at the size
of a thesis. It is generated automatically using the `outline()`
command. The one generated by this document class also contains the
front matter and unnumbered chapters.
]

/ List of figures\:: #block[
If the thesis contains many figures that the reader might want to refer
back to, a list of figures can be included here. It is generated using
`outline()`.
]

/ List of tables\:: #block[
If the thesis contains many tables that the reader might want to refer
back to, a list of tables can be included here. It is generated using
`outline()`.
]

/ List of code listings\:: #block[
If the thesis contains many code listings that the reader might want to
refer back to, a list of code listings can be included here. It is
generated using `outline()`.
]

/ Other lists\:: #block[
If there are other list you would like to include, this would be a good
place. Examples could be lists of definitions, theorems, nomenclature,
abbreviations, glossary etc. 
]

/ Preface or Foreword\:: #block[
A preface or foreword is a good place to make other personal statements
that do not fit whithin the body matter. This could be information about
the circumstances of the thesis, your motivation for choosing it, or
possibly information about an employer or an external company for which
it has been written. Add this in the initializing function of this template.
]

== Body Matter
<body-matter>
The body matter consists of the main chapters of the thesis. It starts
the Arabic page numbering with page~1. There is a great diversity in the
structure chosen for different thesis types. Common to almost all is
that the first chapter is an introduction, and that the last one is a
conclusion followed by the bibliography.

=== Development Project
<sec:development>
For many bachelor and some master projects in computer science, the main
task is to develop something, typically a software prototype, for an
'employer' (e.g., an external company or a research group). A thesis
describing such a project is typically structured as a software
development report whith more or less the following chapters:

/ Introduction\:: #block[
The introduction of the thesis should take the reader all the way from
the big picture and context of the project to the concrete task that has
been solved in the thesis. A nice skeleton for a good introduction was
given by #cite(<claerbout1991scrutiny>, form: "prose");:
#emph[review–claim–agenda];. In the review part, the background of the
project is covered. This leads up to your claim, which is typically that
some entity (software, device) or knowledge (research questions) is
missing and sorely needed. The agenda part briefly summarises how your
thesis contributes.
]

/ Requirements\:: #block[
The requirements chapter should lead up to a concrete description of
both the functional and non-functional requirements for whatever is to
be developed at both a high level (use cases) and lower levels (low
level use cases, requirements). If a classical waterfall development
process is followed, this chapter is the product of the requirement
phase. If a more agile model like, e.g., SCRUM is followed, the
requirements will appear through the project as, e.g., the user stories
developed in the sprint planning meetings.
]

/ Technical design\:: #block[
The technical design chapter describes the big picture of the chosen
solution. For a software development project, this would typically
contain the system arcitechture (client-server, cloud, databases,
networking, services etc.); both how it was solved, and, more
importantly, why this architecture was chosen.
]

/ Development Process\:: #block[
In this chapter, you should describe the process that was followed. It
should cover the process model, why it was chosen, and how it was
implemented, including tools for project management, documentation etc.
Depending on how you write the other chapters, there may be good reasons
to place this chapters somewhere else in the thesis.
]

/ Implementation\:: #block[
Here you should describe the more technical details of the solution.
Which tools were used (programming languages, libraries, IDEs, APIs,
frameworks, etc.). It is a good idea to give some code examples. If
class diagrams, database models etc. were not presented in the technical
design chapter, they can be included here.
]

/ Deployment\:: #block[
This chapter should describe how your solution can be deployed on the
employer’s system. It should include technical details on how to set it
up, as well as discussions on choices made concerning scalability,
maintenance, etc.
]

/ Testing and user feedback\:: #block[
This chapter should describe how the system was tested during and after
development. This would cover everything from unit testing to user
testing; black-box vs. white-box; how it was done, what was learned from
the testing, and what impact it had on the product and process.
]

/ Discussion\:: #block[
Here you should discuss all aspect of your thesis and project. How did
the process work? Which choices did you make, and what did you learn
from it? What were the pros and cons? What would you have done
differently if you were to undertake the same project over again, both
in terms of process and product? What are the societal consequences of
your work?
]

/ Conclusion\:: #block[
The conclusion chapter is usually quite short – a paragraph or two –
mainly summarising what was achieved in the project. It should answer
the #emph[claim] part of the introduction. It should also say something
about what comes next ('future work').
]

/ Bibliography\:: #block[
The bibliography should be a list of quality-assured peer-reviewed
published material that you have used throughout the work with your
thesis. All items in the bibliography should be referenced in the text.
The references should be correctly formatted depending on their type
(book, journal article, conference publication, thesis etc.). The bibliography should
not contain links to arbitrary dynamic web pages where the content is
subject to change at any point of time. Such links, if necessary, should
rather be included as footnotes throughout the document. The main point
of the bibliography is to back up your claims with quality-assured
material that future readers will actually be able to retrieve years
ahead.
]

=== Research Project
<sec:resesarch>
For many master and some bachelor projects in computer science, the main
task is to gain knew knowledge about something. A thesis describing such
a project is typically structed as an extended form of a scientific
paper, following the so-called IMRaD (Introduction, Method, Results, and
Discussion) model:

/ Introduction\:: #block[
See #link(<sec:development>)[3.2.1];.
]

/ Background\:: #block[
Research projects should always be based on previous research on the
same and/or related topics. This should be described as a background to
the thesis with adequate bibliographical references. If the material
needed is too voluminous to fit nicely in the review part of the
introduction, it can be presented in a separate background chapter.
]

/ Method\:: #block[
The method chapter should describe in detail which activities you
undertake to answer the research questions presented in the
introduction, and why they were chosen. This includes detailed
descriptions of experiments, surveys, computations, data analysis,
statistical tests etc.
]

/ Results\:: #block[
The results chapter should simply present the results of applying the
methods presented in the method chapter without further ado. This
chapter will typically contain many graphs, tables, etc. Sometimes it is
natural to discuss the results as they are presented, combining them
into a 'Results and Discussion' chapter, but more often they are kept
separate.
]

/ Discussion\:: #block[
See #link(<sec:development>)[3.2.1];.
]

/ Conclusion\:: #block[
See #link(<sec:development>)[3.2.1];.
]

/ Bibliography\:: #block[
See #link(<sec:development>)[3.2.1];.
]

=== Monograph PhD Thesis
<sec:monograph>
Traditionally, it has been common to structure a PhD thesis as a single
book – a #emph[monograph];. If the thesis is in the form of one single
coherent research project, it can be structured along the lines of
#link(<sec:resesarch>)[3.2.2];. However, for such a big work that a PhD
thesis constitutes, the tasks undertaken are often more diverse, and
thus more naturally split into several smaller research projects as
follows:

/ Introduction\:: #block[
The introduction would serve the same purpose as for a smaller research
project described in #link(<sec:development>)[3.2.1];, but would
normally be somewhat more extensive. The #emph[agenda] part should
inform the reader about the structure of the rest of the document, since
this may vary significantly between theses.
]

/ Background\:: #block[
Where as background chapters are not necessarily needed in smaller
works, they are almost always need in PhD thesis. They may even be split
into several chapters if there are significantly different topics to
cover. See #link(<sec:resesarch>)[3.2.2];.
]

/ Main chapters\:: #block[
Each main chapter can be structured more or less like a scientific
paper. Depending on how much is contained in the introduction and
background sections, the individual introduction and background sections
can be significantly reduced or even omitted completely.

- (Introduction)

- (Background)

- Method

- Results

- Discussion

- Conclusion
]

/ Discussion\:: #block[
In addition to the discussions within each of the individual chapters,
the contribution of the thesis #emph[as a whole] should be thoroughly
discussed here.
]

/ Conclusion\:: #block[
In addition to the conclusions of each of the individual chapters, the
overall conclusion of the thesis, and how the different parts contribute
to it, should be presented here. The conclusion should answer to the
research questions set out in the main introduction. See also
#link(<sec:development>)[3.2.1];.
]

/ Bibliography\:: #block[
See #link(<sec:development>)[3.2.1];.
]

=== Compiled PhD Thesis
<sec:compiledphd>
Instead of writing up the PhD thesis as a monograph, compiled PhD theses
(also known as stapler theses, sandwich theses, integrated theses, PhD
by published work) consisting of reproductions of already published
research papers are becoming increasingly common. At least some of the
papers should already have been accepted for publication at the time of
submission of the thesis, and thus have been through a real quality
control by peer review.

/ Introduction\:: #block[
See #link(<sec:monograph>)[3.2.3];.
]

/ Background\:: #block[
See #link(<sec:monograph>)[3.2.3];.
]

/ Main contributions\:: #block[
This chapter should sum up #emph[and integrate] the contribution of the
thesis as a whole. It should not merely be a listing of the abstracts of
the individual papers – they are already available in the attached
papers, and, as such, not needed here.
]

/ Discussion\:: #block[
See #link(<sec:monograph>)[3.2.3];.
]

/ Conclusion\:: #block[
See #link(<sec:monograph>)[3.2.3];.
]

/ Bibliography\:: #block[
See #link(<sec:development>)[3.2.1];.
]

/ Paper I\:: #block[
First included paper with main contributions. It can be included
verbatim as a PDF. The publishers PDF should be used if the copyright
permits it. This should be checked with the SHERPA/RoMEO
database#footnote[#link("http://sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/index.php");] or with
the publisher. Even when it is no general permission by the publisher,
you may write and ask for one.
]

/ Paper II\:: #block[
etc.
]

== Back Matter
<back-matter>
Material that does not fit elsewhere, but that you would still like to
share with the readers, can be put in appendices. See
#link(<app:additional>)[5];.

= Conclusion
<conclusion>
You definitely should use the `ntnu-thesis` typst template for your
thesis.

#show: appendix.with(chapters-on-odd: chapters-on-odd)
= Additional Material
<app:additional>
Additional material that does not fit in the main thesis but may still
be relevant to share, e.g., raw data from experiments and surveys, code
listings, additional plots, pre-project reports, project agreements,
contracts, logs etc., can be put in appendices. Simply issue the command
```#show: appendix``` in the main `.typ` file, and make one chapter per appendix.
