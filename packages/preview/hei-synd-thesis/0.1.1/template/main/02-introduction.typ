#option-style(type:option.type)[
  Your introduction serves to introduce the topic of your Bachelor thesis and to arouse the reader’s curiosity with an overview. Why it is important and how it is structured, we explain here.

  You can consider an introduction as a teaser for your bachelor thesis. You arouse interest and give a foretaste by presenting your motivation, your method and the state of research in your introduction.

  Convince your examiners already in the introduction that your Bachelor thesis will be exciting. If your professor starts reading your thesis with anticipation and interest, the chances of getting good grades are higher.

  Pay particular attention to the following in your introduction:

  - *Introduce the topic* - What characterizes the topic?
  - *Introduce the goal* - What do you want to achieve with your thesis?
  - *Make the reader curious* - What motivates the reader to read on?
  - *Describe the relevance* - Why is this bachelor thesis scientifically relevant?

  The introduction should have the following content:

  - *Initial situation presentation of the topic* - You introduce the topic with an exciting ‘bait’. You provide initial information on the topic and the object of research and explain the current state of research.
  - *Relevance of the topic motivation* - You justify the relevance of your topic (scientifically) and place it in the context of your field. In addition, it is often required that you disclose your personal motivation.
  - *Objectives* - Your introduction should clearly state what the goal of your paper is and what outcome you hope to achieve upon completion of the bachelor thesis.
  - *Method* - You explain the approach and justify the choice of method.
  - *Structure of the Bachelor’s thesis* - Finally, you give the reader a general overview of your Bachelor’s thesis by explaining the structure, showing the red thread and how the research question is answered.

#infobox()[Welcome to the template’s introductory chapter! Instead of boring you with lorem ipsum, here’s a quick guide to what you can do in Typst and, more specifically, in this template.

  Need more? Check out the #link("https://github.com/hei-templates/hei-synd-report/blob/main/guide-to-typst.pdf")[Guide to Typst].]

== Basic markup

Typst lets you create bold, italic, or monospaced text with ease. You can also sprinkle in equations like $e^(i pi) + 1 = 0$ or even inline code like #raw(lang:"rust", "fn main() { println!(\"Hello, World!\") }"). And because life is better in color: #text(fill:hei-pink)[pink], #text(fill:hei-blue)[blue], #text(fill:hei-yellow)[yellow], #text(fill:hei-orange)[orange], #text(fill:hei-green)[green], and more! #text(fill:color-fire)[Boldly colorize!]

You can also write numbered or unnumbered lists:
- First item
- Second item
  + First Subitem
  + Second Subitem
- Third item

Need equations? Sure! They look great as blocks too:

#figure(
  [$ sin(x) = x - x^3/(3!) + x^5/(5!) - ... = sum_(n=0)^infinity (-1)^n/((2n+1)!)x^(2n+1) $]
)

== Images

As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words. Let’s add one:

#figure(
  project-logo,
  caption: "Project logo"
)

== Tables

Tables are great for organizing data. From simple to complex, Typst handles them all:

#figure(
  table(
    columns: 3,
    stroke:none,
    align:(left+horizon),
    table.header([*Name*], [*Age*], [*City*]),
    [Albert Einstein], [25], [Bern],
    [Marie Curie], [22], [Paris],
    [Isaac Newton], [30], [London],
  ),
  caption: "Simple table"
)

#figure(
  table(
    columns: 8,
    stroke: none,
    align: center,
    inset: 3pt,
    table.vline(x:0, start:1, end:2, stroke:0.5pt),
    table.vline(x:1, start:1, end:2, stroke:0.5pt),
    table.vline(x:2, start:1, end:2, stroke:0.5pt),
    table.vline(x:3, start:1, end:2, stroke:0.5pt),
    table.vline(x:4, start:1, end:2, stroke:0.5pt),
    table.vline(x:5, start:1, end:2, stroke:0.5pt),
    table.vline(x:6, start:1, end:2, stroke:0.5pt),
    table.vline(x:7, start:1, end:2, stroke:0.5pt),
    table.vline(x:8, start:1, end:2, stroke:0.5pt),
    [\[31:27\]], [], [], [\[24:20\]], [\[19:15\]], [\[14:12\]], [\[11:7\]], [\[6:0\]], table.hline(stroke:0.5pt),
    [funct5], [aq], [rl], [rs2], [rs1], [funct3], [rd], [opcode], table.hline(stroke:0.5pt),
    [#align(center)[5]], [], [], [#align(center)[5]], [#align(center)[5]], [#align(center)[3]], [#align(center)[5]], [#align(center)[7]],
  ),
  caption: [Complex table]
)

== Boxes

Highlight key points with these fun boxes (and more):

#table(
  columns: 2,
  stroke: none,
  [ #infobox()[Infobox: For highlighting information.] ],
  [ #ideabox()[Ideabox: Share a brilliant idea.] ],
  [ #warningbox()[Warningbox: Proceed with caution!] ],
  [ #firebox()[Firebox: This is 🔥!] ],
  [ #rocketbox()[Rocketbox: Shoot for the moon!] ],
  [ #todobox()[Todobox: Just do it!] ],
  )
  #todo[Personnal todo before marking this thesis as final]

== Citations, Acronyms and Glossary

Add citations with `@` like @zahnoDynamicProjectPlanning2023 or #cite(<zahnoDynamicProjectPlanning2023>, supplement:[p.7ff]) (stored in `/tail/bibliography.bib`).

Acronym terms like #gls("it") expand on first use and abbreviate after #gls("it"). Glossary items such as #gls("rust") can also be used to show their description as such: #gls-description("rust"). Acronyms and glossary entries auto-generate at the document’s end (defined in `/tail/glossary.typ`).

#pagebreak()

== Code

Besides writing inline code as such #raw(lang:"rust", "fn main() { println!(\"Hello World\") }") you can also write code blocks like this:

#figure(
  sourcecode()[
    ```rust
fn main() {
  let ship = Starship::new("USS Rustacean", (0.0, 0.0, 0.0));
  let destination = (42.0, 13.0, 7.0);
  let warp = ship.optimal_warp(ship.distance_to(destination));

  println!("🖖 {} traveling to {:?} at Warp {:.2}", ship.name, destination, warp);
  if warp <= 9.0 {
    println!("✨ Warp engaged!");
  } else {
    println!("⚠️ Warp failed!");
  }
}
```],
  caption:"First part of the USS-Rustacean code",
)
or directly from a file
#let code_sample = read("/resources/code/uss-rustacean.rs")
#figure(
  sourcecode()[
    #raw(code_sample, lang: "rust")
  ],
caption: [Second part of the USS-Rustacean code from `/resources/code/uss-rustacean.rs`]
)

== Context Problem


#gls("hei")
#gls("rust") #glspl("rust")


#cite(<zahnoDynamicProjectPlanning2023>)
#cite(<zahnoDynamicProjectPlanning2023>, supplement:[p.7ff])

```rust
fn main() {
  println!("Hello World!");
}
```
