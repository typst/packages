  In the analysis part a so called ”State of the Art” research is done. It describes the knowledge about the studied matter through the analysis of similar or related published work. It provides a comprehensive overview of what was done, what has been done in the field and what should be further investigated.

  A State of the Art is done in multiple phases:

  + Problem formulation (Research questions)
  + Literature search
  + Literature evaluation
  + Analysis and interpretation
  + Presentation

  Good sources for a literature search depend on your subject matter. For engineering hereafter a incomplete list:
