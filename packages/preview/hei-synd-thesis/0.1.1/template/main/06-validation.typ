  In addition to presenting the *results of your research in relation to your research question*, it is imperative that the validation section of your bachelor's thesis adheres to certain principles to ensure clarity, coherence, and rigor. Here are some additional considerations to enhance the validation process:

  - *Objective Description of Data*: Provide an objective and detailed description of the data used in your analysis.
  - *Utilize Graphs and Tables*: Visual aids such as graphs, charts, and tables can greatly enhance the clarity and impact of your results presentation.
  - *Link Results to Research Questions*: For each result presented, explicitly link it back to the corresponding research question or hypothesis.
  - *Ranking Results by Importance*: Prioritize your results by ranking them in order of importance or relevance to your research objectives.
  - *Confirmation or Rejection of Hypotheses*: Evaluate each result in light of the hypotheses formulated in your thesis.
