# May

A simple and elegant document template for multiple daily tasks.

## Usage

This is my personal typst template designedfor homework, report or some other documents. You can obtain the same styles of this template by simply adding the follows two lines at the top of your document:

```typst
#import "@preview/may:0.1.0": *
#show: may-sans
// ...
// Your typst documents here
```

Alternatively you can also initialize a project with _may_ by running the following command:

```sh
typst init @preview/may
```

This will create a new folder named `may` in the current path, along with a sample file `main.typ` as the start point.

## Touying Slides Template

We also provide a touying theme that is great for presentations! You can create slides in may theme as simple as adding these lines at the top:

```typst
#import "@preview/may:0.1.0": *

#show: may-pre.with(
  config-info(
    title: [Welcome to May!],
    subtitle: [Demo of Touying Slides Template May],
    author: [Carlos Mel],
    date: datetime.today(),
    institution: [Qiuzhen College, Tsinghua University]
  ),
)
```

You can modify the parameters in `config-info` to anything you prefer, and you can also customize the footer of this template by explicitly passing a footer to `may-pre` function. After the `show` command, `may-pre` will automatically create new sections and slides according to your 1st headers and 2nd headers. There are also some functions to create special slides in this theme, they are `title-slide`, `focus-slide` and `image-slide`. For more concreate usages you can refer to `slides.typ` template generated by `typst init @preview/may` and our showcases.
