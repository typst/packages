# minimal-note
This is a Typst template for a single-column paper intended for notetaking.

## Usage
You can use this template in the Typst web app by clicking "Start from template" on the dashboard and searching for `minimal-note`.

Alternatively, you can use the CLI to kick this project off using the command
```
typst init @preview/minimal-note
```

Typst will create a new directory with all the files needed to get you started.

## Configuration
This template exports the `minimal-note` function with the following named arguments:

- `title`: The paper's title as content.
- `author`: The paper's author as content.
- `date`: The paper's date as datetime.

The function also accepts a single, positional argument for the body of the paper.

The template will initialize your package with a sample call to the `minimal-note` function in a show rule. If you want to change an existing project to use this template, you can add a show rule like this at the top of your file:

```typ
#import "@preview/minimal-note:0.10.0": minimal-note

#show: minimal-note.with(
  title: [Paper Title],
  author: [Your Name],
  date: datetime.today().display("[month repr:long], [year]")
)
```
