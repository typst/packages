This is a document template for creating professional-looking documents with Typst, tailored for Fontys Hogeschool.
<!-- It can also be found on the [Typst Universe](https://typst.app/universe/package/unofficial-fontys-paper-template). -->

## Introduction

This research paper template is designed to help students and researchers at Fontys Hogeschool create professional-looking documents with Typst. It provides a clean and structured layout, allowing you to focus on your content rather than formatting.

Should the style update, you can easily update the template by changing the version number in the import statement (if there were no braking changes).

## Requirements

- Typst builder installed on your system (Explained in `Getting Started`).

## Getting Started

To get started with this Typst document template, follow these steps:

1. **Install Typst**: I recommend to use VSCode with [Tinymist Typst Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=myriad-dreamin.tinymist). You will also need a PDF viewer in VSCode if you want to view the document live.
2. **Import the template**: Import the template into your own typst document. `#import "@preview/unofficial-fontys-paper-template:0.1.0": fontys-paper`
3. **Set the available options**: Set the available options in the template file to your liking.
4. **Start writing**: Start writing your document.
