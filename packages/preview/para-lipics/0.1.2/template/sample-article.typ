= Typesetting instructions - Summary

LIPIcs is a series of open access high-quality conference proceedings across all fields in informatics established in cooperation with Schloss Dagstuhl.
In order to do justice to the high scientific quality of the conferences that publish their proceedings in the LIPIcs series, which is ensured by the thorough review process of the respective events, we believe that LIPIcs proceedings must have an attractive and consistent layout matching the standard of the series.
Moreover, the quality of the metadata, the typesetting and the layout must also meet the requirements of other external parties such as indexing service, DOI registry, funding agencies, among others.

The present document is an unofficial Typst reproduction of the LaTeX LIPIcs sample paper.
It uses the `para-lipics` template, which largely follows the official `lipics-v2021.cls` LaTeX style.
