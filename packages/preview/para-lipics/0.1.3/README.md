# para-lipics: A LIPIcs-style Template for Typst

A community-maintained Typst reproduction of the official LaTeX `lipics-v2021.cls` template.

See [`sample-article.typ`](https://github.com/para-lipics/para-lipics/blob/main/template/sample-article.typ) for a complete setup with placeholder content:

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** For best results, install the required font manually, see [Requirements](#requirements).

## Basic usage

Import the template in your project with:

```typ
#import "@preview/para-lipics:0.1.3": *

#show: para-lipics.with(...)

// body of the paper

#bibliography("bibliography.bib")
```

The template parameters are listed in the following.

## Requirements

This template requires **Typst ‚â• 0.13.1**.

Due to current limitations in Typst's font handling, the _Computer Modern Sans_ font must be installed manually.
Note that this is **not** _New_ Computer Modern, it's the original Knuth-designed version.
If this font is missing, the _New Computer Modern Sans_ fallback font will be used instead (which may alter the visual fidelity of the result).

- If you're using the **web app**, upload the `.ttf` or `.otf` file directly into your project.
- If you're using the **CLI**, either install the fonts on your system or specify them using the `--font-path` option.

## Theorem handling

The `para-lipics` template relies on the [ctheorems package (v1.1.3)](https://typst.app/universe/package/ctheorems/) to handle theorem-related content.
Several common environments are already provided by the template: `theorem`, `definition`, `lemma`, `observation`, `corollary`, and `proof`.

The user can define custom theorem-like and proof-like environments by reusing the `thm-base()` and `proof-base()` functions as follows.

```typst
#import "@preview/para-lipics:0.1.3": *

#let remark = thm-base("remark", "Remark")
#let proof-sketch = thm-base("proof-sketch", "Proof sketch")
...
```

## Caveats

This template is **unofficial**, and **Dagstuhl Publishing does not currently accept Typst documents**.

Most conferences using the LIPIcs format accept **PDF submissions**, so _in theory_, you can submit a paper typeset with Typst.
However, we strongly discourage using this template for official submissions: your paper may be desk rejected if the publisher's formatting requirements are not strictly followed.

If your paper is accepted, you will still need to **convert your Typst source to LaTeX** to submit it to the publisher.
This may be feasible via tools like [**Pandoc**](https://pandoc.org/) or even LLMs.

Note that PDFs generated with Typst can be submitted to most open-access e-print repositories (arXiv, HAL...).

For now, this template is best suited for authors who:
- enjoy working in Typst
- want a LIPIcs-like preview during drafting
- are comfortable converting to LaTeX later if needed

Once Typst reaches version 1.0.0, this template may also serve as a lobbying tool to encourage Dagstuhl to officially support Typst.

**Note:** This template is a work in progress.
Perfect fidelity with the official LIPIcs format is not guaranteed (yet).
