= First heading

The theorems inherit 2 levels from the headings and the figures inherit 1 level from the headings.

#theorem[Some theorem.]
#theorem[Some theorem.]
#figure([SOME FIGURE], caption: [some figure])
#figure([SOME FIGURE], caption: [some figure])

== Subheading

#theorem[Some theorem.]
#figure([SOME FIGURE], caption: [some figure])
#figure([SOME FIGURE], caption: [some figure])

= Second heading

#theorem[Some theorem.]
#figure([SOME FIGURE], caption: [some figure])
#theorem[Some theorem.]
