= You #emph[can] have an appendix here.

You can have as much text here as you want. The main body must be at most $8$
pages long. For the final version, one more page can be added. If you want, you
can use an appendix like this one.

The `\onecolumn` command above can be kept in place if you prefer a one-column
appendix, or can be removed if you prefer a two-column appendix.  Apart from
this possible change, the style (font size, spacing, margins, page numbering,
etc.) should be kept the same as the main body.
