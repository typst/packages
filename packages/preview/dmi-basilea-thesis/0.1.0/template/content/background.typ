== What is Typst?

Typst is a modern markup-based typesetting system designed to be a powerful yet user-friendly alternative to LaTeX. Released in 2023, it combines the simplicity of Markdown with the typographic quality and programmability traditionally associated with LaTeX, making it an excellent choice for academic writing.

Key advantages of Typst include:
- *Fast compilation*: Near-instantaneous preview updates as you type
- *Clear error messages*: Helpful diagnostics that pinpoint exactly what went wrong
- *Modern syntax*: Intuitive markup that's easier to learn than LaTeX
- *Built-in scripting*: Powerful programming capabilities for advanced customization
- *Excellent math support*: Beautiful mathematical typesetting out of the box

== Why a Typst Template?

While LaTeX has been the de facto standard for academic typesetting for decades, its steep learning curve and cryptic error messages can be cumbersome. This Typst template maintains compatibility with University of Basel's formatting requirements while offering a more approachable writing experience.

The template handles all the formatting details automatically, allowing you to focus on your content rather than wrestling with compilation errors or obscure package conflicts.
