# Modern BUAA Graduate Thesis Template

A **[Typst](https://typst.app)** template for BUAA graduate thesis, capable of quickly and accurately generating BUAA graduate thesis.

- üì¶ Out of the box, you only need to focus on writing
- üîë 100% compliant with BUAA's latest thesis format file, more accurate than Word
- üî© Directly includes packages like [lovelace](https://typst.app/universe/package/lovelace), [subpar](https://typst.app/universe/package/subpar) for pseudocode and subfigure editing

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This is not an official template. Although it strictly follows relevant specifications, there is no Word version!! The foolish format checking system seems not to support PDF??

## Quick Start

Check out [thesis.typ](https://github.com/wangjq4214/buaa-thesis/blob/main/template/thesis.typ) and [thesis.pdf](https://github.com/wangjq4214/buaa-thesis/blob/main/example/thesis.pdf) to see the specific code and generated PDF file.

This package only provides one main API for writing your own graduate thesis, greatly simplifying the writing process:

```typ
#import "@preview/modern-buaa-thesis:0.1.0": thesis

#show thesis.with()

= Introduction

= Technical Point 1

= Technical Point 2

= Technical Point 3
```
