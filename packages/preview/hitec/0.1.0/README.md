# The HITEC Template

As quoted from Eli Billauer's original README in his [LaTeX HITEC class](https://ctan.org/pkg/hitec):

> This is the HITEC class. As the name implies, it is intended for use on technical documents in hi-tec companies.
> It is based upon the article class, but it looks VERY different. In fact, one of the design aims was to escape the academic look of the well-known LaTeX document classes.

This repository contains a Typst adaptation of the HITEC class, with some modifications to better suit modern document design practices.

## Usage

There are two ways to use this template in your Typst project.

### Online via Typst Webapp

Go to [the template's homepage on Typst Web App](https://typst.app/universe/package/hitec) and click on `Create project in app`.

You can then start editing your document directly in the web interface.

### Locally via Typst Universe

Before proceeding, ensure you have Typst installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Typst website](https://typst.app/open-source/#download) or install it via a package manager.

In your working directory, run:

```bash
typst init @preview/hitec:0.1.0 my-report
```

This will create a new Typst project with the HITEC template set up under the directory `my-report`.
