# Typst package: `peano`

`peano` is a math utility package that provides you with representations of specialized number types, mathematic special functions, number theory related operations and so on. The name of the package comes from [Peano axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms), which builds up the framework of [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number) &#x2115;, one of the the most elementary concepts in mathematics, aiming to convey this package's orientation as a simple utility package.

## Number types

`peano` currently supports two number types and their arithmetics:

- `rational`: representation of [rational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number) &#x211a; in the form of fractions
- `complex`: representation of[ complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number) &#x2102;

It is a pity that Typst doesn't currently support custom types and overloading operators, so actually these numbers are represented by Typst's `dictionary` type, and you have to invoke specialized methods in the corresponding sub-module to perform arithmetic operations over these numbers.

To use these number types you have to first import the corresponding sub-module:

```typ
#import "@preview/peano:0.1.0"
#import peano.number: rational as q, complex as c
```

Each sub-module contains a method called `from`, by which you can directly create a number instance from a string or a built-in Typst number type. Arithmetic methods in these modules will automatically convert all parameters to the expected number type by this `from` method, so you can simply input strings and built-in number types as parameters.

### Rational numbers

```typ
#import "@preview/peano:0.1.0"
#import peano.number: rational as q

#q.from("1/2") // from string
#q.from(2, 3) // from numerator and denominator
#q.add("1/2", "1/3", "-1/5") // addition
#q.sub("2/3", "1/4") // subtraction
#q.mul("3/4", "2/3", "4/5") // multiplication
#q.div("5/6", "3/2") // division
#q.limit-den(calc.pi, 10000) // limiting maximum denominator
#q.pow("3/2", 5) // raising to an integer power

#q.to-str(q.from(113, 355)) // convert to string
#q.to-math(q.from(113, 355)) // convert to formatted `math.equation` element
```

Currently, `rational.from` supports fraction notation and decimal notation with an optional set of [repeating digits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeating_decimal) enclosed in square brackets.

```typ
#import "@preview/peano:0.1.0"
#import peano.number: rational as q

// normal values

#q.from("1/2")
#q.from("-2/3") // sign before numerator
#q.from("5/-4") // sign before denominator

// infinity or indeterminate values

#q.from("1/0")  // infinity
#q.from("-1/0") // negative infinity
#q.from("1/-0") // also negative infinity
#q.from("0/0")  // NaN

// decimal notation

#q.from("0.25")
#q.from("0.[3]") // repeating part wrapped in bracket
#q.from("3.[142857]")
#q.from("1.14[514]")
#q.from("1[2.3]") // repeating part can cross decimal point
```

A rational number can be displayed in both string and math format by using the `rational.to-str` and `rational.to-math` methods.

```typ
#import "@preview/peano:0.1.0"
#import peano.number: rational as q

#let value = q.from(113, 355)

#q.to-str(value)
#q.to-math(value)
```

### Complex numbers

```typ
#import "@preview/peano:0.1.0"
#import peano.number: complex as c

#c.from("1+2i") // from string
#c.from(3, 4) // from real and imaginary parts
#c.add("1+2i", "3+4i", "-2+3i", "6-5i", "2i")
```

## Number theory

The number theory sub module `peano.ntheory` currently supports prime factorization and the extended Euclidean algorithm that gives out the coefficients $u$ and $v$ in BÃ©zout's identity $\gcd (a, b) = u a + v b$.

## Mathematic functions

The `peano.func` sub-module provides a collection of basic mathematic functions. Some of them are also included in Typst's `calc` module, but extended to support complex number input. Other self-defined functions also support function input if they can be defined in the complex field &#x210;.

### Special functions

The `peano.func.special` sub-module include special functions such as the gamma function, zeta function, Gauss error function.
