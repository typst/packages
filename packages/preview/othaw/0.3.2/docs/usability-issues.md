# Usability Issues

The main purpose of  good typography (i.e. a documents structure, design etc.) is to convey the contents as good as possible to the reader. Or how the famous typographer [Jan Tschichold](https://www.typolexikon.de/tschichold-jan/) puts it:

> Zweck jeder Typographie ist Mitteilung. Die Mitteilung muss in kürzester, einfachster, eindringlichster Form erscheinen.
> 
> (*The purpose of all typography is communication. The message must appear in the shortest, simplest, most emphatic form*.)

## Abundant Frontmatter

Current Bachelor theses and similar works at DHBW don't fulfill this goal very well. One prevalent problem is the amount of frontmatter they contain. I.e. from the title-page up to the beginning of the first chapter there is an abundant amount of pages with contents that could be placed elsewhere or be omitted at all.

I've analyzed the last ten documents I reviewed. They have the following number of pages for frontmatter (F) and contents proper (C):
1. F: 11 – C: 61
2. F: 10 – C: 73
3. F: 10 – C: 57
4. F: 12 – C: 71
5. F:  6 – C: 60
6. F: 11 – C: 64
7. F: 12 – C: 78
8. F: 10 – C: 70
9. F: 16 – C: 57
10. F: 6 – C: 57

That means, the reader has to scroll through up to 16 pages to get to the contents of the document – each time the file is opened! This qualifies easily as bloatware.

The only elements I consider ***necessary*** as ***frontmatter*** are:
- title-page
- table of contents 

Even the latter is debatable in a PDF-docu
ment if a PDF-TOC is included, which can be displayed nicely in the sidebar of the PDF reader. 

Considering the above mentioned end-users, it is also debatable, if these documents really need an abstract. All stakeholders involved typically discuss what contents is expected before the document is written and the introductory chapter (if done well) transports these ideas too (perhaps on 2-5 pages instead of one as in an abstract).

Other content is ***necessary or helpful***, but can be ***placed in the appendix*** of the document:
- declaration of authorship (necessary for legal reasons)
- confidentiality statement (necessary if the partner company desires so)
- glossary (helpful)
- list of abbreviations/acronyms (helpful)

Then there is content which I consider merely as page filler and can be ***omitted*** at all (or if really necessary in special cases, can be placed in the appendix too):
- list of tables
- list of figures
- list of source code

A last word onto this topic: I have the faint suspicion, that many students like these page fillers, because they think a comprehensive document is more impressive and leads to better grades. But I hope that it has become clear now, that this is rather annoying for the reader.

## Crowded Title-Page

The title-page should convey the most important information about the document it covers. But the title-pages I've seen are actually a vast collection of words and text wherein the reader has to search for the information he or she wants. Moreover there seems to be a competition on using as many font styles and sizes as possible, which adds to the impression of overcrowding. 

Apart from that, there is no real standard for the title-page – neither for the content nor for the layout. The above mentioned ten documents showed about five different base layouts, each with its own variations.

A title-page for these documents should show the following information with different levels of importance:
- Level 1:
	- Title
- Level 2:
	- Author
- Level 3:
	- Document category (e.g. "Bachelor Thesis", "Project Documentation")
	- Faculty/department/study programme (e.g. "Computer Science")
	- DHBW location (*Studienakademie*)
- Level 4 (there may be variations here, depending on the document category):
	- Date of submission
	- Reviewer at partner company
	- Reviewer at DHBW
	- Partner Company
	- Course-ID, Student-ID

Other text currently visible on the title-pages adds just some kind of "noise". There are e.g. prepositions like "*in* Computer Science", "*at* DHBW Karlsruhe" or "*by* John Doe" that add no real information but some even use a line of their own. Or phrases like "*für die Prüfung zum Bachelor of Science*" ... well, what else is the purpose of a Bachelor thesis? And do we really need the complete address of the partner company on the title page or would the company name not suffice?

## Sub-Optimal Page Typography
Good page typography strives for optimal legibility. This is mainly achieved by using a high-quality body font in an adequate size with a line length of about 60-70 letters. All other measures of the page layout like line height, margins or paragraph spacing are derived thereof. I do not have the impression that the current recommendations are determined by these goals and therefore need some overhaul. 

Just one example is the recommendation for a 1.5x line-height, which presumably stems from times when typewrites were used. On a typewriter one could only choose a line-height of 1x/1.5x/2x and 3x (1x being the standard). So, it was common practice to use a 1.5x line-height for situations where reviewers wanted to add handwritten comments to a text later on.

Nowadays people use the comment function of their favorite PDF reader to solve this problem. And for those working on paper, a good page layout offers sufficient whitespace on the margins for comments. 

As we are no longer restricted to typewriter mechanics or other technical limitations, we can (and should) exploit all possibilities of modern digital typesetting systems to implement good typography, thus producing documents with a high degree of legibility and usability.
