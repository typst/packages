# Typst sub-outlines

This package provides the `suboutline` command that does the same thing as `outline` but
restricted to the current heading. This is inspired by
[minitoc](https://ctan.org/pkg/minitoc?lang=en) package for LaTeX.

*This package is a fork of the
[minitoc](https://gitlab.com/human_person/typst-local-outline) package, which is no
longer maintained by the original author.*

## Example

```typst
#import "@preview/suboutline:0.1.0": *
#set heading(numbering: "1.1")

#outline()

= Heading 1

#suboutline()

== Heading 1.1

#lorem(20)

=== Heading 1.1.1

#lorem(30)

== Heading 1.2

#lorem(10)

= Heading 2

```

This produces

## Usage

The `suboutline` function has the following signature:

```typst
#let suboutline(
  title: none, target: heading.where(outlined: true),
	depth: none, indent: none, fill: repeat([.])
) { /* .. */ }
```

This is designed to be as close to the
[`outline`](https://typst.app/docs/reference/meta/outline/) funtions as possible. The
arguments are:

- **title**: The title for the local outline. This is the same as for
  [`outline.title`](https://typst.app/docs/reference/meta/outline/#parameters-title).
- **target**: What should be included. This is the same as for
  [`outline.target`](https://typst.app/docs/reference/meta/outline/#parameters-target)
- **depth**: The maximum depth different to include. For example, if depth was 1 in the
  example, "Heading 1.1.1" would not be included
- **indent**: How the entries should be indented. Takes the same types as for
  [`outline.indent`](https://typst.app/docs/reference/meta/outline/#parameters-indent)
  and is passed directly to it
- **fill**: Content to put between the numbering and title, and the page number. Same
  types as for
  [`outline.fill`](https://typst.app/docs/reference/meta/outline/#parameters-fill)

## Unintended consequences

Because `suboutline` uses `outline`, if you apply numbering to the title of outline with
`#show outline: set heading(numbering: "1.")` or similar, any title in the sub-outline 
will be numbered and be a level 1 heading. This cannot be changed with `#show outline:
set heading(level: 3)` or similar unfortunately.
