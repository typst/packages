The abstract is a concise, self-containing one-page description of the work:
what was the problem, what was done, and what are the results. Do not include
charts or tables in the abstract. Put the abstract in the primary language of
your thesis first and then the translation when that is needed. International
students do not need to include an abstract in Finnish.
