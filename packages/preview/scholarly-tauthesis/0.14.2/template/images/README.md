# images/

Place the images related to your project here. You can then include the images
into your thesis with the [`image`][image] function:
```typst
#image("path/to/images/filename.svg", width:100%)
```
If you place the `image` call into a [`figure`][figure], you will get a
numbered picture that you can reference.
