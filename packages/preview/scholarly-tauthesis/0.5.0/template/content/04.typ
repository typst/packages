= Conclusions <conclusions>

This template and the writing guidelines should help achieving a
consistently formatted and clear documents. A similar template is
also available for Word.

Every writing and presentation must have a conclusion. This fact
is here emphasized by having this short and rather artificial
summary also in this template. The purpose of this chapter is to
discuss how the things we set out to do in the introduction
succeeded, and compare our results to other literature on the
same topic.
