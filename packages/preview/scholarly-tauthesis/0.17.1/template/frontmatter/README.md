# Front matter

This folder works a bit differently from the folders
`mainmatter/` and `appendices`. This is because you as a
writer of your thesis do not get to decide the order in
which you front matter sections appear.

Instead, the idea is that you simply write the *contents*
of your front matter sections such as abstracts, preface
and glossary into the files that are contained in this
`frontmatter/` folder and let the template worry about the
ordering of the contents.
