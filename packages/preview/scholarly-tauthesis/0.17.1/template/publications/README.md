# Publications

This folder is for storing your PhD publication files.
They should either be in PDF form or given as Typst source
code files. When using Typst, do not modify page settings
in the attachment file, as the settings need to match with
the rest of your thesis.

**Note** that adding any PDF files as attachments to your
thesis will prevent *accessible* output formats such as
PDF/A-3a or PDF/UA-1 from being produced by the Typst
compiler. This is because most often PDF files distributed
by scientific publishers do not contain accessibility tags,
which cannot be added restrospectively by Typst. You can
still compile your thesis with PDF attachments, if you do
not use PDF/A-3a or PDF/UA-1 as the output format.

Ideally you would publish each of your papers via an Open
Access channel with a permissive license, such that you
could then use the Typst source code of your publication
as an attachment instead of the corresponding PDF file
downloadable from a publisher site.
