This #link("https://typst.app/docs/")[typst] document template is intended to
support writing theses in the technical fields in Tampere University. The
template is based on the earlier one from the Tampere University of Technology,
but it has been updated for use in Tampere University from 2019 onwards.
Version #version(0,11,0) of the typst compiler does not yet automatically
create PDF/A-compliant documents. *Once your thesis is ready, remember to feed
it to the PDF/A converter at https://muuntaja.tuni.fi before submitting it*.

Acknowledgements to those who contributed to the thesis are generally presented
in the preface. It is not appropriate to criticize anyone in the preface, even
though the preface will not affect your grade. The preface must fit on one
page. Add the date, after which you have not made any revisions to the text, at
the end of the preface.
