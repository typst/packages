# Lacy-UBC Math Project Template
This is a Typst template for UBC Math 100/101 group projects. It aims to reproduce most of the existing LaTex template while providing a more user-friendly interface for students who are not familiar with LaTex.

For more information, please refer to the [documentation](/manual.pdf).

## Update Note
**0.1.1 → 0.2.0** The package had undergo a revamp, backward compatibility is broken. Please refer to the updated manual to learn about the new project structure.
- Greatly enhanced package capabilities.
- Plenty of info emission for package plugins (lame over-engineering).
- Code documentation.
- Supposed performance boost (less `state` updates I hope).

## Disclaimer
This template does not represent opinions or stands of the UBC, the "UBC" in its name only indicates its initial purpose.
