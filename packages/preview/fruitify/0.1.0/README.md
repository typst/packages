# Fruitify

Make your equations more fruity!

This package automatically replaces any single letters in equations with fruit emoji.

Refer to `example-documentation.typ` for more detail.

## Emoji support

At the time of writing this, typst does not yet have good emoji support for PDF.
This means that even though this package works as intended,
the output may look very wrong when exporting to PDF.
Therefore, it is recommended to stick with PNG export for now.
