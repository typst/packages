# splash

Add a splash of color to your project with these palettes for [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst).

This library provides different color palettes with human-readable names in
Typst dictionaries. Currently there are just a few different palettes to choose
from. Any contributions or suggestions are welcome!

*Note*: `splash` is in the [Typst Package Repository](https://github.com/typst/packages). See how to use 
it in the example below.

## Usage

```typst
#import "@preview/splash:0.4.0": xcolor

#box(width: 3em, height: 1em, fill: xcolor.dandelion)
```

## Documentation

See the different colors in the [documentation](https://github.com/kaarmu/splash/blob/v0.4.0/doc/main.pdf).
