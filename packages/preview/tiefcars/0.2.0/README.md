> The worst way to format *your* document

Have you ever wondered, "Why did no one make a template for LCARS yet?"

Well, simply because it's a pain. There's so many curves. So much sufferage.

But fear no more: Today, We present to you **TiefCARS**! Your Typst template
to format a document in a LCARS style.

## Usage

To use TiefCARS with the Typst web app, choose “Start from template” and select TiefCARS. You will also need to include or install the `Antonio` font.

To import the package manually in your Typst project, use:

```typst
#import "@preview/tiefcars:0.2.0": *
```

The easiest way to get started is to use first select a theme:

```typst
#show: tiefcars.with(theme: "tng")
```

Then, you can enable layouting:

```typst
// Enables multi page layout with left bound buttons
#show: multi-page-layout(
  title: [This Document Is Amazing], // A title displayed on the first page of the mult-page-layout
)

Your content
```

This creates a default layout, giving you access to a left bound LCARS interface. Headings with level one are currently implemented to be special, but this may change.

You can also create a title page / single page document using `single-page-layout`:

```typst
#show: single-page-layout(
  title: [This Document Is Amazing], // A title displayed on the top right corner of the page
  subtitle-text: [Your subtitle text.], // A subtitle text. This should fill up the rest of the interface to avoid it looking empty.
  top-height: 4, // This defines how many buttons (rectangles) will be displayed on the left bar before 
)

Your content
```

## Examples
