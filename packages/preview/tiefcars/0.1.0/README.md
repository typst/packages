# TiefCARS

> The worst way to format *your* document

Have you ever wondered "Why did no one make a template for LCARS yet?"

Well, simply because it's a pain. There's so many curves. So much sufferage.

But fear no more: Today, We present to you **TiefCARS**! Your Typst template
to format a document in a LCARS style.

## Usage

To use TiefCARS with the Typst web app, choose “Start from template” and select TiefCARS. You will also need to include or install the `Antonio` font.

To import the package manually in your Typst project, use:

```typst
#import "@preview/tiefcars:0.1.0": default-layout, tiefcars
```

The easiest way to get started is to use the following lines:

```typst
/* === Set up lcars with your theme === */
#show: tiefcars.with(theme: "tng")

/* === Enable the default layout === */
#show: default-layout.with(
    /* === The title of the document, fancyful and amazing */
  title: [TiefCARS],
  subtitle-text: [
    /* === Text displayed in the top part under the title */
    Bla bla
  ]
)

Your content
```

This creates a default layout. You can also build your own layout using the `sidebar` and `buttons` components.

How I shan't explain.
