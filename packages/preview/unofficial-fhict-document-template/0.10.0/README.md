## Requirements

- Roboto font installed on your system (is optional but without it the style is not whole)
- Typst builder installed on your system (Explained in `Getting Started`).

## Features

- Consistent formatting for titles, headings, subheadings, and paragraphs.
- Clean and professional document layout.
- FHICT Style.
- Configurable document options.
- Helper functions.

## Getting Started

To get started with this Typst document template, follow these steps:

1. **Check for the roboto font**: Check if you have the roboto font installed on your system. If you don't, you can download it from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto).
2. **Install Typst**: I recommend to use VSCode with the [Typst LSP Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nvarner.typst-lsp). You will also need a PDF viewer in VSCode if you want to view the document live.
3. **Import the template**: Import the template into your own typst document. `#import "@preview/unofficial-fhict-document-template:0.10.0": *`
4. **Set the available options**: Set the available options in the template file to your liking.
5. **Start writing**: Start writing your document.
