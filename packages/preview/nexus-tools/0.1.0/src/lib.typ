= Description

Easily implement handy features from a curated collection of frequently used
package functionality, such as data storage or custom defaults. This library was
created as part of the development of #url(
"https://typst.app/universe/search/?q=author%3A%22Maycon%20F.%20Melo%22")[my
other Typst projects;] it contains functionality shared across multiple projects
that would otherwise need to be maintained and updated individually, but is now
centralized in a single place. This is not intended to be a full-fledged
development toolset, but rather a compartmentalization of shared resources.

You can use this library without restrictions as a development aid, especially
for packages.
