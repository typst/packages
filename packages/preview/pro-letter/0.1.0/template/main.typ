I am writing to formally request the closure of the enchanted vault at Fantasy
Finance Faucets held in my name, Alexandra Bloom.

Attached is the official Fae Council Closure Order for your verification and
records.

The account is identified by the vault number: *12345FAE*.

As the rightful owner, I _authorize the closure of the aforementioned vault_ and
_request that all enchanted funds be redirected to the Fae Council Reserve_.
Please find the necessary details for the transfer enclosed.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this magical matter.
