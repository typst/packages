/// Creates a presentation title grid.
///
/// The layout supplies every cell's content itself, so the surrounding
/// `mosaic.slide` consumes no slide bodies.
///
/// ```typ
/// #show: mosaic.setup.with(
///   title: [Tree-based slide grids],
///   subtitle: [A layout model for Typst],
///   authors: [Ada Lovelace],
///   date: [2026-08-03],
/// )
///
/// #mosaic.slide(layout: "title", variant: "centered")
/// ```
///
/// *Inheritance*
///
/// Each of `title`, `subtitle`, `authors`, and `date` defaults to `auto`, which
/// takes the value configured on `setup`. To override an inherited value:
///
/// - Pass explicit content or a string to replace it.
/// - Pass `none` to suppress an inherited `title`, `subtitle`, or `date`.
/// - Pass `()` to suppress inherited `authors`.
///
/// *Variants*
///
/// Text variants:
///
/// - `centered`: the heading stack at the slide's center, details anchored to
///   the bottom edge.
/// - `bordered`: a thin rule border inset from the slide edge with the
///   centered stack inside it.
/// - `ruled`: the heading stack over a full-width accent rule with the
///   details beneath, flush left at the slide's vertical center. The
///   beamer-metropolis title page, and the default.
/// - `kicker`: the magazine masthead. A strong opening rule, the subtitle set
///   as a small tracked-caps eyebrow in the accent color, the title below it,
///   and the details anchored to the bottom edge.
/// - `panel`: a vertical side panel in the deck's text color carries the
///   details, knocked out in the canvas color under a short accent rule; the
///   heading stack takes the main field.
/// - `academic`: the conference-poster arrangement. Author names carry
///   superscript affiliation numbers over a numbered affiliation legend and a
///   contact line. Requires at least one author.
///
/// One image variant, which requires `image` and reads `position`:
///
/// - `image` with `position: "left"`, `"right"`, `"top"`, or `"bottom"` (the
///   default is `"left"`): a full-bleed picture beside or above the title
///   stack, sized by `tracks`.
///
/// A full-slide photographic title is not a variant: give the slide a
/// `background:` plane and compose the type yourself, reading the deck's own
/// metadata back through `info()`.
///
/// To invert any of these, with the slide ground in the deck's text color and
/// the type knocked out, pass `invert: true` on the slide rather than picking
/// a variant; inversion is a polarity, not a structure.
///
/// *Authors*
///
/// Every variant accepts the same `authors`, written in whichever of three
/// spellings fits the deck: one name as content or a string, an array of
/// names, or an array of records built with `layouts.author` for the authors
/// that carry affiliations, an ORCID iD, or an address. Names and records mix
/// freely in one array. Every variant renders every author field through the
/// same tiers: a byline of names with linked ORCID labels, superscript
/// affiliation numbers, and the corresponding asterisk, then one fine-print
/// line per kind of information: the numbered affiliation legend, the contact
/// addresses, the date. Kinds never share a line, and the superscript markers
/// appear exactly when the deck names more than one institution.
///
/// *Labels*
///
/// Every resolved cell carries a label, so appearance comes from native Typst
/// rules:
///
/// - `mosaic-cell-title`: the title stack, in every variant. Most variants
///   compose the subtitle and the details inside it too.
/// - `mosaic-cell-details`: the affiliation and date band, in the `panel` and
///   `academic` variants, which set those tiers outside the title cell.
/// - `mosaic-cell-authors`: the byline, in the `academic` variant.
/// - `mosaic-cell-image`: the picture, in the `image` variant.
///
/// One further label is not a cell: the display line of the title stack carries
/// `mosaic-title-display`, which is where a theme states the title's display
/// size.
///
/// *Styling*
///
/// The layout is structural. A rule on `<mosaic-cell-title>` reaches the whole
/// composed stack: title, subtitle, and details alike. Recoloring it is what
/// light-on-dark compositions over a photograph need.
///
/// ```typ
/// #show label("mosaic-cell-title"): set text(fill: white)
/// #mosaic.slide(
///   layout: "title",
///   background: mosaic.components.image("cover.webp", scrim: black.transparentize(55%)),
/// )
/// ```
///
/// Sizing it works the same way, because the display line carries its own
/// `<mosaic-title-display>` label and the theme's display size lands there
/// rather than on the cell. The tiers below are ordinary ems of the cell, so
/// one rule scales the stack as a unit and the proportions hold. That is how
/// to ask for quiet type in the corner of a photograph.
///
/// ```typ
/// #show label("mosaic-cell-title"): set text(size: 0.45em)
/// ```
///
/// A theme states the display size on the inner label instead, which leaves
/// the outer one free for the deck to scale:
///
/// ```typ
/// #show label("mosaic-title-display"): set text(size: 2em, weight: "semibold")
/// ```
///
/// -> dictionary

// the panel variant's side panel.

// table; `unit` is what they multiply, and it is the whole difference between
// the two places details renders. Composed inside the title cell, the tiers
// take the cell's own em (the default), so they follow the rest of the stack
// when a rule rescales it; see title-display. The panel and academic bands
// are their own <mosaic-cell-details> cells instead, so they pass the deck's
