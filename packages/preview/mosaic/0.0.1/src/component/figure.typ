/// Creates a centered, captioned figure sized to its cell.
///
/// This is the in-cell counterpart to the
/// #link("../slides/image.html")[image layout]. Use the layout when one
/// picture is the whole point of a slide; use this when a figure shares the
/// slide with other content, most often as one of two side by side.
///
/// ```typ
/// #mosaic.slide(layout: "content", columns: 2)[== Before and after][
///   #mosaic.components.figure(path("before.png"), caption: [Baseline])
/// ][
///   #mosaic.components.figure(path("after.png"), caption: [After the reform])
/// ]
/// ```
///
/// *Pictures*
///
/// Given an image source, this differs from `mosaic.components.image` in its
/// defaults, which are the ones a chart or a photograph in a cell wants rather
/// than the ones a full-bleed background wants: `fit` is `"contain"`, so the
/// picture is never cropped, and the result is centered in its cell.
///
/// The default `height: auto` gives the picture the cell's full height, less
/// whatever the caption and its gap consume. Nothing has to be measured by hand,
/// and adjacent cells agree: each picture is as large as its own aspect ratio
/// allows, and the captions share one baseline at the foot of the cells.
///
/// *Other content*
///
/// A table, a chart drawn in code, or a diagram is passed as content instead of
/// a source. Such a body cannot be re-fitted the way a picture can, so it is
/// laid out at the cell's width and then scaled as a whole if it is still too
/// tall, exactly as `mosaic.fit` does. Its own arrangement is preserved, the
/// caption keeps the size the deck gave it, and a body that already fits is left
/// alone. It is never magnified past its natural size.
///
/// ```typ
/// #mosaic.components.figure(
///   table(columns: 3, ..cells),
///   caption: [Estimates by specification],
///   kind: table,
/// )
/// ```
///
/// A content body that does not fill its cell sits at the top of it and is
/// captioned directly beneath itself, rather than stretching and captioning at
/// the foot of the cell as a picture does.
///
/// Scaling a table also costs it the automatic `kind` a native `figure` would
/// have detected, so state `kind: table` for the table numbering and the "Table"
/// supplement. Further arguments go to the native `figure` here, and to the
/// native `image` for a picture source.
///
/// *Height*
///
/// `auto` reads the size of the cell, not the space left over inside it, so a
/// figure that follows prose in the same cell needs an explicit height:
///
/// ```typ
/// #mosaic.slide(layout: "content", columns: 2)[== Two revenues][
///   - Payroll taxes carry the system
///   - Consumption taxes are regressive
///   #mosaic.components.figure(path("photo.jpg"), height: 50%)
/// ][
///   #mosaic.components.figure(path("chart.png"), caption: [Shares since 1980])
/// ]
/// ```
///
/// An explicit height sizes the picture area, and the caption follows directly
/// beneath it rather than sitting at the foot of the cell. Such a figure takes
/// only the height it was given, so it leaves whatever shares its cell where it
/// was.
///
/// *Captions*
///
/// A `caption` composes a native Typst `figure`, so it takes the deck's own
/// `show figure.caption` styling, figure numbering, and references. Switch the
/// numbering off with an ordinary `set figure(numbering: none)`. Without a
/// caption no `figure` is involved: the body is centered and sized, nothing more.
///
/// -> content
#let figure(

  /// a diagram. Use `path(...)` for an image asset in the calling project.
