// The deck record: its shape, its one writer, and its reader.
//
// `deck-state.typ` owns the channel (one Typst `state` value plus the guard
// that keeps it written once). This module owns what travels through it. The
// two are separate files because the channel is a leaf that anything may
// import, while the record's shape depends on the validators of the subsystems
// it carries, and those subsystems read the channel themselves.
//
// The record is a flat dictionary of exactly seven fields. Nothing else may be
// added to it without a reason that survives the write-once rule: a field here
// is configuration `setup` declared, not a place to accumulate state during a
// compilation.
//
//   settings         dictionary | none   Everything a slide renders against:
//                                        colors, roles, spacing, notes
//                                        geometry, content defaults, deck
//                                        metadata, and the overflow policy.
//                                        `none` only in the no-deck fallback
//                                        below. Built and validated by
//                                        settings.typ.
//   layouts          dictionary          The configured layouts, by name, that
//                                        heading slides and named `slide`
//                                        commands resolve through. `(:)`
//                                        deliberately means "outside a deck",
//                                        so it is the one field whose fallback
//                                        differs from what `setup` writes.
//   frozen-counters  array of counter    Counters held still across the frames
//   frozen-states    array of state      and states likewise, so an
//                                        incremental slide's chrome does not
//                                        advance once per frame.
//   handout          bool                Whether every slide collapses to its
//                                        final frame.
//   output           str                 "slides", "speaker", or "notes": the
//                                        rendering target, which decides page
//                                        geometry and whether notes print.
//   paper            dictionary          Resolved slide dimensions, never a
//                                        preset name, because the printed
//                                        outputs scale a thumbnail of this
//                                        size onto a page of another.
//
// Readers that can run outside a deck (components, cell insets) take
// `default-deck-record` instead of failing, so a component rendered in a plain
// Typst document still has library defaults to paint from.
