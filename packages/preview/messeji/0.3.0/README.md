# messÄ“ji

_messÄ“ji_ ("Message" in Japanese) is a Typst package for typesetting chat
histories in a modern, minimal design, inspired by popular messengers. No manual
copying to your Typst document required, just pass in a JSON file.

![Example Chat](docs/example.jpg)

Main features of _messÄ“ji_ include:

- Support for quoted messages
- Image messages (with and without captions)
- Displaying timestamps between messages
- Simple data model to read from external files (JSON, YAML, ...) if you want to
  typeset very long chat histories
- Reacting to messages

To see how it works, read the short introduction below, or
[the messeji user manual](https://github.com/Tanikai/messeji/blob/main/docs/messeji-guide.pdf)
for a more in-depth explanation.

## Import

```typst
#import "@preview/messeji:0.3.0": messeji
```

## Basic Usage

The JSON file just needs to be an array of messages:

```json5
[
  {
    "date": "2026-12-25T09:41:00",
    "msg": "Merry Christmas! ðŸŽ„",
    "from_me": false
  },
  {
    "msg": "Thank you! ðŸ˜Š",
    "ref": "Merry Christmas! ðŸŽ„", // Responses to messages have to be duplicated
    "from_me": true
  }
]
```

Then, you can import the JSON file with the built-in JSON parser from Typst and
typeset it by calling `messeji`:

```typst
#let parsed-data = json("mychat.json")
#messeji(chat-data: parsed-data)
```

If you don't want to use a JSON file or parse your own filetype, you just have
to pass a list of messages to `messeji`:

```typst
#let my-messages = (
  (
    date: "2024-01-01T12:00:00",
    msg: "This is defined directly in the Typst file.",
    from_me: false,
  ),
  (
    msg: "Nice!",
    from_me: true,
  ),
)
#messeji(chat-data: my-messages)
```

## Theming

You can also customize the appearance of the messages. This is explained in
[the messeji user manual](https://github.com/Tanikai/messeji/blob/main/docs/messeji-guide.pdf).

## Known Issues

Currently, there is no support for:

- Group chats (only 1-on-1 chats)
- Displaying names / profile pictures next to the messages

These features are currently not planned to be implemented. However, if you need
them, [create an issue](https://github.com/Tanikai/messeji/issues) and I'll look
into it (if I have the time).
